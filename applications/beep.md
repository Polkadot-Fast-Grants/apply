# Polkadot Fast Grant Application

# üìù Beep

**Tagline:** Offline-capable wallet enabling seamless fiat and crypto transactions via USSD and WhatsApp.

## üåü Project Overview

### Brief Description
Beep is advancing Web3 accessibility by providing offline-capable mobile money services. Our platform enables users in emerging markets to perform complex multi-chain transactions using familiar interfaces like USSD (*123#) and WhatsApp, using cellular network connectivity without requiring smartphone internet or technical blockchain knowledge. Users can send fiat or crypto to any phone number, regardless of the underlying blockchain chain, abstracting away the complexity of chains and networks.

**PS**: Offline-capable refers to not requiring internet connectivity; however, cellular network access is required for USSD, and internet connection is need for WhatsApp functionalities.

### Integration with Polkadot
Beep integrates with Polkadot through:

- **Plaza/Moonbeam Integration**: Primary parachains for cross-chain asset transfers
- **XCM Protocol**: Enabling seamless parachain-to-parachain communication through XCM-enabled contracts
- **Cross-Ecosystem Bridging**: Connecting Polkadot liquidity with the Cosmos ecosystem via established protocols like Picasso Network
- **Intent-Based Architecture**: Abstract complex operations into simple "send money" commands

### Team Interest and Ecosystem Commitment
Our team is deeply invested in the Polkadot ecosystem beyond just this project. As a Polkadot Ambassador, I have actively contributed to ecosystem growth through:

- **Educational Content**: Authored multiple technical articles and tutorials on Substrate development, published on [polkadot study](https://polkadot.study/tutorials/substrate-in-bits/) and [dot-alert](https://dot-alert.gitbook.io/dot.alert), and shared across developer and web3 communities reaching over 5K visits
- **Substrate in Bits Contributions**: Core contributor to the "Substrate in Bits" educational [series](https://github.com/Chondria/SiB/blob/main/README.md), helping developers understand complex Substrate concepts through simplified explanations reaching 1K visitors
- **Community Building**: Participated in Polkadot developer meetups in Northern Nigeria, directly onboarding 5+ developers to the ecosystem
- **Technical Mentorship**: Guided emerging Substrate-based projects on Telegram, reaching 20+ developers

After successfully building and testing Beep on Cosmos (50+ beta testers), we recognize that Polkadot's advanced interoperability features and parachain architecture are essential for creating seamless cross-ecosystem experiences. Our existing relationship with the Polkadot ecosystem, combined with proven user traction, positions us uniquely to bridge sophisticated blockchain technology with everyday users in emerging markets.

### Core Components Architecture

#### 1. Multi-Ecosystem Intent Engine
The intent engine abstracts complex cross-chain operations into simple user commands. Users can express intents like "send $10 to +2348012345678" and the engine determines optimal routing, whether via Cosmos, Polkadot, or cross-ecosystem bridges.

**Key Features:**
- Cross-chain route optimization
- Fee estimation and comparison
- Automatic slippage protection
- Failed transaction recovery

#### 2. XCM Integration Layer
Direct integration with Polkadot's XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging) for parachain interoperability:

**Implementation Details:**
- Custom XCM program construction for cross-parachain transfers
- Multi-location asset addressing
- Automated fee calculation for destination chains
- Transaction status monitoring across parachains
- Error handling with retry mechanisms

#### 3. Non-Custodial Fiat Escrow System
Multiple "DAOs" of agents pool fiat and crypto to service end-users' intents

**Architecture:**
- Plaza/Moonbeam Beep contracts
  - Intent settlement
  - Smart contract wallet
  - Economic layer
- Hybrid fiat management system
- Picasso Beep contracts
  - Cosmos-Polkadot link
  - Cross-Ecosystem Intent settlement
  - Smart contract wallet
  - Economic layer
- Independent Solvers
- Chain abstracted API and frontend
