# üìù Prosk Assist

## üåü Project Overview

- **Tagline**: Streamline job applications with AI-powered, role-specific form filling and cover letter generation.
- **Description**: Prosk Assist is a Chrome and Safari web extension (with a supporting website) that automates job application form filling using AI. It saves job seekers hundreds of hours by intelligently filling forms, generating tailored cover letters, and supporting multiple role-specific profiles (e.g., Software Developer, Data Scientist). Unlike basic resume parsers, it uses fine-tuned LLMs to understand and answer unique form questions accurately, improving resume shortlisting chances.
- **Polkadot Integration**: Prosk Assist could leverage Polkadot‚Äôs decentralized identity protocols (e.g., KILT Protocol) to securely store and verify user credentials and resumes on-chain, ensuring privacy and trust. Additionally, Polkadot‚Äôs parachains could enable scalable, low-cost storage of user data and fine-tuned LLM models.
- **Why We‚Äôre Interested**: Our team is passionate about solving real-world problems for job seekers. After researching the struggles of applying to 500+ jobs in today‚Äôs market, we developed Prosk Assist to save time, reduce stress, and empower users to land their dream roles with tailored, high-quality applications.

### üîç Project Details

- **Technology Stack**:
  - **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript, CSS (for Chrome/Safari extension and website), React for the website dashboard.
  - **Backend**: Node.js, Express for the website API; Python for LLM integration and fine-tuning.
  - **AI/LLM**: Fine-tuned models (e.g., based on LLaMA or BERT) hosted on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Hugging Face).
  - **Blockchain**: Polkadot/KILT Protocol for decentralized identity and data storage (exploratory).
  - **Database**: MongoDB for user profiles and role-specific data.
- **Core Components**:
  - **Web Extension**: Injects scripts to autofill forms, supports multiple role-specific tabs (e.g., Software Developer, Data Scientist).
  - **Website**: User dashboard to manage resumes, skills, and role profiles.
  - **LLM Module**: Fine-tuned per user to answer unique form questions accurately.
  - **Cover Letter Generator**: Analyzes job descriptions and generates tailored cover letters.
  - **Resume Enhancer**: Analyzes job descriptions and suggests user to add and remove keywords, skills. Also suggests good resume template for companies.
- **PoC/MVP**: We‚Äôve built a prototype Chrome extension that fills basic forms using predefined data (available at \[GitHub placeholder\]). Current work focuses on LLM integration and role-specific tab functionality.
- **Mockups/UI**:
  - Extension Popup: A simple interface with buttons to select role tabs (e.g., ‚ÄúSoftware Developer‚Äù, ‚ÄúData Scientist‚Äù) and trigger form filling.
  - Website Dashboard: Displays user profiles, role-specific resumes, and generated cover letters.
- **Data Models/API**:
  - **User Profile**: `{ userId, email, roles: [{ roleName, resume, skills, keywords, projects, description }], coverLetterTemplates }`
  - **API Endpoints**:
    - `POST /api/generateCoverLetter`: Takes job description and role, returns tailored cover letter.
    - `GET /api/user/roles`: Retrieves user‚Äôs role-specific profiles.
    - `POST /api/llm/answer`: Sends form question to fine-tuned LLM, returns answer.
- **Limitations**:
  - Does not handle CAPTCHA or complex multi-step authentication.
  - File uploads (e.g., resumes) require manual user action due to browser security.
  - Initial LLM fine-tuning is cloud-based, not on-chain (Polkadot integration is exploratory).

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

- **Fit in Polkadot Ecosystem**: Prosk Assist fits into Polkadot‚Äôs vision of user-centric, decentralized applications. By integrating with KILT Protocol, it can offer verifiable, user-controlled credentials (e.g., education, work history) stored on-chain, enhancing trust in job applications. It could also leverage Polkadot‚Äôs Plaza/Polkadot Hub for community-driven job marketplaces.
- **Target Audience**: Job seekers (e.g., recent graduates, career switchers) applying to multiple roles across industries, particularly in tech (e.g., Software Developer, Data Scientist).
- **Needs Met**:
  - Saves time by automating repetitive form filling.
  - Increases resume shortlisting rates with role-specific, tailored applications.
  - Simplifies cover letter creation with AI-generated, job-specific content.
- **Similar Projects**:
  - **In Polkadot**: No known projects directly address AI-powered job application automation. KILT Protocol focuses on identity but not form filling.
  - **Outside Polkadot**: Tools like LinkedIn Easy Apply or resume parsers exist but lack role-specific customization and LLM-driven question answering.
  - **Differentiation**: Prosk Assist‚Äôs multi-role support, fine-tuned LLMs, and potential Polkadot integration (for secure data/identity) set it apart.

### üìä Development Status

- **Current State**: A prototype Chrome extension exists that autofills basic forms using predefined data. We‚Äôve researched LLM fine-tuning for question answering and mocked up the multi-role tab interface.
- **Research**: Analyzed job application pain points (500+ applications per job seeker, 100s of hours spent) and tested existing tools (e.g., LinkedIn Easy Apply, resume parsers) to identify gaps.
- **Next Steps**: Integrate LLM for dynamic question answering, implement role-specific tabs, and explore Polkadot/KILT integration.
