## 🌟 Project Overview

### Tagline

An AI-powered off-price fashion marketplace with on-chain verified excess stock transparency.

### Brief Description

Masari is building an AI-powered off-price marketplace that helps fashion brands move excess inventory profitably, while giving shoppers a personalized experience that saves them time and money. Fashion brands lose $2.5-5B in unsold stock annually, and new EU laws coming in 2026 will ban the destruction of inventory. At the same time, 82% of shoppers want AI to reduce research time, and 60-75% already shop resale or outlet. Masari taps into these shifts by combining AI personalization, price, and purpose. Now, we’re adding an on-chain transparency layer that lets brands verify specific product batches as excess stock. This badge-based module improves trust, supports compliance, and can be reused across the ecosystem as an open-source tool.

### Relation to Polkadot

Our transparency verification module will be deployed on a Polkadot-compatible chain (e.g. Moonbeam). It enables fashion brands to record a public, immutable proof that specific product batches are excess inventory. This will show how Polkadot infrastructure can enable real-world use cases like supply chain transparency, regulatory compliance, and ESG accountability in retail.

### Why We're Creating This Project

We’re solving a $2.5B+ unsold stock problem in fashion, while anticipating regulatory pressure and shifting consumer expectations. We believe blockchain can offer lightweight, verifiable transparency for brands without requiring deep technical integration. This project also lays the foundation for more advanced sustainability data (like CO₂ tracking) and strengthens Masari’s vision of a more efficient and ethical fashion ecosystem.

### 🔍 Project Details

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React) with TailwindCSS, deployed on Vercel
- **Blockchain Layer:** Solidity smart contracts on a Polkadot-compatible EVM chain (e.g. Moonbeam)
- **Web3 Integration:** Ethers.js or Polkadot.js for contract interaction
- **Data Handling (optional):** Supabase for pre-chain metadata handling and admin auth (if needed)
- **Tooling:** Hardhat for smart contract development and testnet deployment

### Core Components & Architecture

- **Smart Contract**
  - Stores verified product batch records including: product IDs, brand ID, and excess stock attestation
  - Supports read/write functions with access control
- **Admin Interface (Web UI)**
  - Allows Masari or brand admins to submit batch-level verification (via form or CSV upload)
  - Connects to blockchain and pushes verification data to the contract
- **Public Viewer (Web UI)**
  - Lets shoppers or auditors view excess stock verification badge per product
  - Optional: filter by "Verified" products or view more details from on-chain data

### Prior Work or Proof of Concept

This feature is a new addition to Masari Tech’s ecosystem. While the transparency tracker is new, our broader marketplace has already shown traction: a 200+ user waitlist, competition wins, and active brand outreach. We’ve also partnered with a sustainability organization offering 10 free SKU-level Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) once brand integration begins - which this module lays the groundwork for.

### Mockups / UI Concepts

We plan to build:

- A simple **Admin dashboard** (to submit excess stock batch attestations)
- A lightweight **public viewer** (to show verification badges and data on product pages)

Mockups will include:

- Input form for brands or Masari admins
- Badge UI on product pages (e.g. "Verified Excess Stock")
- Optional tooltip or detail view for transparency

### Data Model / API Overview

**Smart Contract Fields (per record):**

- `batchId` (string)
- `productIds` (array of strings)
- `brandId` (string or wallet address)
- `timestamp` (uint)
- `verified` (bool, always true if written to chain)

**Public Read Functions:**

- `getVerificationByProductId(productId)`
- `getBatchDetails(batchId)`

### What This Project _Will Not_ Include

- It will **not verify product origin or CO₂ impact** in the MVP, though fields will be reserved for future use.
- It will **not include wallet-based brand signatures** or cryptographic proofs in v1 - brands will attest through a trusted submission flow.
- It will **not replace Masari’s core marketplace**, but act as a modular verification layer.

### 🧩 Ecosystem Fit

### Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

Masari brings a new real-world use case to Polkadot: on-chain verification of excess inventory in fashion retail. While most projects focus on DeFi, gaming, or infrastructure, we apply blockchain to transparency, compliance, and sustainability (all urgent challenges in fashion).

### Who is your target audience?

Fashion brands looking to manage and monetize excess stock in a compliant, trust-enhancing way (especially in the EU). Shoppers who want affordable, personalized, and transparent fashion. For this module, we also target developers and builders interested in transparency use cases beyond DeFi.

### What needs does your project meet?

We help brands prove that certain product batches are excess inventory to support compliance and ESG reporting. We also help shoppers trust that they’re buying from a responsible source.

### Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem?

None that we’re aware of. Most supply chain projects focus on logistics or provenance. We focus on excess inventory verification - a gap that Polkadot is well-positioned to fill.

We’re excited to apply our technical skills to the Polkadot ecosystem and are designing this project to start simple, open-source, and composable.

## 📊 Development Status

Development for the transparency module has not yet started. This application outlines the full scope, architecture, and roadmap for the project.

However, we have already begun development on the broader Masari platform, which includes:
- Our **waitlist and marketing website** (in progress), which will host key pages like blog, community, and about
- Our **e-commerce marketplace**, which will include AI personalization features to help shoppers find items faster

All repositories are currently private, but the transparency module developed under this grant will be fully open-source.

## 📅 Development Roadmap

This project will be delivered in three milestones over the course of two months. The goal is to launch a fully functional, open-source module that enables excess stock batch verification on-chain, along with a public viewer UI. Our roadmap follows a clear progression: first laying the blockchain foundation, then layering on the web interfaces and documentation needed to showcase and share the tool.

## 🔮 Future Plans

After the Fast-Grant, we plan to integrate this transparency module directly into our marketplace. We may expand it to support CO₂ impact tags using SKU-level LCAs as brand partnerships grow.

We plan to raise pre-seed funding to scale our tech and operations, while also exploring additional partnerships and grant opportunities. Later this year, we aim to launch a beta version of the marketplace to test with early users. However, we’re still validating the ideal timing for launch based on expert insights and market signals.

We're also actively growing the brand through marketing, community building, and ongoing industry engagement.
