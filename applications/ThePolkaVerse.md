# 📝 Name of your Project

## 🌟 Project Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tagline (one sentence summary)

The Polkaverse allows users to create and own digital assets that come to life with a real-time physics sandbox and AI chat integration to solve the problem of static, unengaging digital assets powered by Polkadot Asset Hub.

- A brief description of your project

PolkaVerse is a decentralized application that bridges the gap between digital ownership and real-world interaction, powered by Polkadot. Our smart contract on AssetHub enables users to create, own, and verify digital assets, which can then be spawned into a dynamic Unity WebGL physics sandbox and engaged with through AI-powered conversations. By leveraging Polkadot’s scalable asset management and cross-chain interoperability, Polkaverse enhances the tangibility of digital assets, offering users a new, immersive way to experience and interact with their virtual possessions across the broader Polkadot ecosystem.

- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Polkadot

Polkadot's unique AssetHub parachain enables low-cost, highly scalable, and standardized asset creation and management across the entire Polkadot ecosystem. Additionally, Polkadot's cross-chain interoperability ensures that assets created on AssetHub can seamlessly integrate with future dApps, wallets, and parachains, extending the reach and utility of user-generated assets beyond just Polkaverse.

- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project

My team (Aya and William) LOVES fun interactive experiences.

A lot of us have digital assets, however, what else can we do besides looking at a 6 figure jpg of a monkey?
According to data from Cryptoslam.com, we can notice a huge drop in interest for digital assets with Apr 2025 having the lowest volume and unique seller figures since July 2021. 

That’s why we made the PolkaVerse, a dapp that allows you to create and own digital assets that come to life with a real-time physics sandbox and AI chat integration to solve the problem of static, unengaging digital assets powered by Polkadot Asset Hub.

### 🔍 Project Details

We expect applicants to have a solid idea about the project's expected final state. Therefore, please submit (where relevant):

- An overview of the technology stack to be used

Polkaverse utilizes Metamask for secure and decentralized user authentication, allowing users to connect to the Polkadot AssetHub network. Ethers.js facilitates real-time fetching of digital asset data from our smart contract deployed on the Westend AssetHub Testnet. Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash model powers personalized AI interactions with each user’s assets, while Unity WebGL provides an immersive physics sandbox for spawning and interacting with them.

- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed

We have a smart contract deployed on Polkadot Westend Asset Hub to securely create, manage, and verify ownership of user-generated digital assets in a decentralized, trustless way. Once created, users can both chat with the asset using a chatbot initialized from the asset’s description, and spawn them into our 3D sandbox with its respective 3D Model URL. Our contract ensures users can own, prove, and interact with their assets across Polkadot’s entire ecosystem of chains, wallets, and apps in a highly scalable and low-cost manner.

### 🧩 Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
PolkaVerse enables the next generation of engaging digital assets on Polkadot by turning static collectibles into interactive, AI-powered digital assets. We unlock new forms of utility and entertainment for digital asset holders across Polkadot’s growing ecosystem!


- Who is your target audience?
Our target audience is anyone who owns or purchases digital assets on Polkadot and seeks more utility, personalization, and interactivity beyond simple ownership.

- What need(s) does your project meet?
We meet the growing demand for digital assets to offer more than passive ownership by introducing real-time interaction, AI-driven companionship, and physics-based engagement, making assets feel more alive and valuable.


- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem?
We have not identified any other projects providing AI-driven, interactive experiences with digital assets on Polkadot.
  - If so, how is your project different? 
  N/A
  - If not, why might such a project not exist yet?
  Most teams in the Polkadot ecosystem currently focus on infrastructure, DeFi, and developer-centric tools. Very few projects prioritize consumer-grade interactive experiences that bridge emotional engagement and entertainment for mainstream users — a gap PolkaVerse directly addresses and one that my team is super passionate about!



> **Note**: We prioritize projects building on Plaza/Polkadot Hub, games, and DeFi applications, though all types of projects will be considered.
