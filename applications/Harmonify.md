# üìù Harmonify

## üåü Project Overview

### One-liner
‚ÄúHarmonify: Blockchain‚Äësecured, AI‚Äëpowered soundtrack seamlessly curating the perfect playlist for every mood and moment with complete data transparency.‚Äù

### Brief description
Harmonify is a Polkadot‚Äëbased, blockchain‚Äëtransparent, decentralised AI platform that gives you full rights over your personal data pods‚Äîseamlessly integrating with existing music services and educational resources to democratize access and ownership. By deploying AI models on‚Äëchain and leveraging decentralised knowledge graphs, it crafts dynamic, fine‚Äëgrained playlists tailored to your mood, habits, and preferences, while ensuring explainability and cross‚Äëplatform interoperability. Even at just 1% of its potential, Harmonify sparks a transformative shift in global music ecosystems, igniting cultural diversity and creative freedom for listeners and artists alike.

## Why We Chose Polkadot

- **Shared Security & Scalability**  
  Leverages the Relay Chain‚Äôs pooled security while letting our parachain scale AI workloads independently.

- **Substrate Customizability**  
  Tailor's runtime modules for decentralised AI agents, fine‚Äëgrained data‚Äëpod permissions, and on‚Äëchain explainability.

- **Cross‚ÄëChain Interoperability**  
  Uses XCMP to natively integrate with other Web3 ecosystems (e.g., OriginTrail) without external bridges.

- **Fork‚Äëless Upgrades & Governance**  
  Enables seamless protocol and model updates via on‚Äëchain governance‚Äîno hard forks or downtime.

### Motivations behind building the project
For too long, music‚Äëstreaming platforms have treated listener data as their asset, hiding recommendation logic behind black‚Äëbox algorithms and limiting how much users can shape their own discovery. Hours of listening habits, mood signals, and personal preferences are collected, yet fans can‚Äôt see how those insights drive their playlists‚Äîor export and tweak them outside a single silo. This opaque approach undermines user trust and favours mass‚Äëmarket hits over emerging or niche artists, stifling creative diversity and leaving listeners frustrated by one‚Äësize‚Äëfits‚Äëall feeds.
 

### üîç Project Details


**Development Status**  
Development has not yet begun, as our lead is focused on dissertation writing and will defend in early May.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Blockchain Layer:** Moonbeam (EVM‚Äëcompatible Polkadot parachain)  
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity for DataPod and AI curation logic  
- **Cross‚ÄëChain Messaging:** Polkadot XCM  
- **Off‚ÄëChain Services:** Node.js microservices, Phala Network for private compute, IPFS for data hosting  
- **Front End & Indexing:** React/Next.js with Tailwind CSS, The Graph and Substrate RPCs initially, moving into app development in Swift and Kotlin

## Core Components & Protocols  
1. **DataPod Registry Contract**  
   Manages creation, ownership, and permissions of user data pods.  
2. **AI Curator Contract**  
   Encodes the playlist generation and feedback logic on‚Äëchain.  
3. **XCM Relayer Module**  
   Handles secure message and data transfers between parachains.  
4. **AI‚ÄëOracle Adapter**  
   Triggers off‚Äëchain AI inference and returns results on‚Äëchain.  
5. **Knowledge Graph Integration**  
   Retrieves and verifies metadata from OriginTrail‚Äôs decentralised graphs.  

## Exclusions & Limitations  
- **On‚ÄëChain Audio Streaming & DRM:** Not supported in initial launch.  
- **Mobile Clients:** Deferred to a later phase.  
- **Advanced Governance & Tokenomics:** Postponed until core features are stable.  



### üß© Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
Harmonify is delivered as a decentralised application (dApp) built on the Moonbeam parachain, leveraging EVM‚Äëcompatible smart contracts to manage user data pods and on‚Äëchain AI curation logic while inheriting Polkadot‚Äôs shared security.
  
- Who is your target audience?
Harmonify‚Äôs core users are music fans and artists seeking better personalised playlists and (or) transparency within their listening data. We aim to act as a 3rd party tool tool that provides clarity of data usage on top of apps like Spotify, while using this data to provide better music recommendation suggestions.

- What need(s) does your project meet?
It addresses the demand for data sovereignty by giving users full rights over their listening histories and preferences, overcoming opaque data harvesting on mainstream platforms like Spotify and Apple Music. It also fulfils the need for explainable, fine‚Äëgrained playlist personalisation by deploying AI curation logic on‚Äëchain, ensuring transparent decision‚Äëmaking and continuous improvement via user feedback.

  
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem?
To my knowledge, there are no d-apps in the Polka ecosystem focusing on AI‚Äëdriven, on‚Äëchain music playlist curation. This gap likely exists because on‚Äëchain handling of large multimedia data is technically difficult.

### Team members
At the moment, this is a solo venture, although I have other developers [from Cambridge] interested in collaborating if I need support during this project.


### Team Code Repos

- https://github.com/ramstar3000/EnviroChain = Decentralised platform for smart environmental monitoring
- https://github.com/LeoS0112/SherlockGame = Sherlock Holmes inspired puzzle game, development into adding on-chain components is being completed


### Team's experience

I‚Äôm relatively new to the Polkadot ecosystem, having learned and built projects through EasyA hackathons. In my first solo event, I placed in the top 10, proof that I can tackle this ambitious project independently, drawing on experience from various codebases and leveraging EasyA‚Äôs guidance for any on‚Äëchain challenges.

## üìä Development Status

Unfortunately development has not begun yet, at the moment I am iterating through different ways to implement this project, while completing my thesis for university, then I will focus on building this project.
