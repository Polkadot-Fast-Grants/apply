# üìù Harmonify

## üåü Project Overview

### One-liner
‚ÄúHarmonify: Blockchain‚Äësecured, AI‚Äëpowered soundtrack seamlessly curating the perfect playlist for every mood and moment with complete data transparency.‚Äù

### Brief description
Harmonify is a Polkadot‚Äëbased, blockchain‚Äëtransparent, decentralised AI platform that gives you full rights over your personal data pods‚Äîseamlessly integrating with existing music services and educational resources to democratize access and ownership. By deploying AI models on‚Äëchain and leveraging decentralised knowledge graphs, it crafts dynamic, fine‚Äëgrained playlists tailored to your mood, habits, and preferences, while ensuring explainability and cross‚Äëplatform interoperability. Even at just 1% of its potential, Harmonify sparks a transformative shift in global music ecosystems, igniting cultural diversity and creative freedom for listeners and artists alike.

## Why We Chose Polkadot [TODO review this]

- **Shared Security & Scalability**  
  Leverages the Relay Chain‚Äôs pooled security while letting our parachain scale AI workloads independently.

- **Substrate Customizability**  
  Tailors runtime modules for decentralized AI agents, fine‚Äëgrained data‚Äëpod permissions, and on‚Äëchain explainability.

- **Cross‚ÄëChain Interoperability**  
  Uses XCMP to natively integrate with other Web3 ecosystems (e.g., OriginTrail) without external bridges.

- **Fork‚Äëless Upgrades & Governance**  
  Enables seamless protocol and model updates via on‚Äëchain governance‚Äîno hard forks or downtime.

### Motivations behind buildinig the project
For too long, music‚Äëstreaming platforms have treated listener data as their own asset, hiding recommendation logic behind black‚Äëbox algorithms and limiting how much users can shape their own discovery. Hours of listening habits, mood signals, and personal preferences are collected, yet fans can‚Äôt see how those insights drive their playlists‚Äîor export and tweak them outside a single silo. This opaque approach undermines user trust and favours mass‚Äëmarket hits over emerging or niche artists, stifling creative diversity and leaving listeners frustrated by one‚Äësize‚Äëfits‚Äëall feeds.
 

### üîç Project Details

We expect applicants to have a solid idea about the project's expected final state. Therefore, please submit (where relevant):

- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- Any PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- What your project is *not* or will *not* provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and clarify any limitations

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, why might such a project not exist yet?
