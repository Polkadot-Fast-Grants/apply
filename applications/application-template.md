# 📝 Glomood AI

## 🌟 Project Overview

Please provide the following:

- "Diamond Challenge" accredited product fusing mental health, artificial intelligence and therapy to be more accessible to young adults.

Project Description:
Glomood is an AI-powered therapy platform designed to make mental health support more accessible, stigma-free, and effective for young adults. By integrating artificial intelligence with evidence-based therapeutic techniques, Glomood provides personalized, on-demand emotional support. The platform offers real-time mood tracking, AI-driven therapy sessions, and peer community engagement, ensuring users receive timely and relevant mental health care.

Integration with Polkadot:
Glomood aims to integrate Polkadot’s decentralized ecosystem to enhance data security, privacy, and interoperability. By leveraging Polkadot’s parachain architecture and cross-chain communication, Glomood can securely store sensitive mental health data while ensuring transparency and user control over their information. Additionally, smart contracts can facilitate secure therapist-user interactions, reducing barriers to access and increasing trust in digital therapy.

Why We’re Interested in Building This for Glomood:
Our team is passionate about bridging the gap in mental health accessibility, especially for young adults who often lack affordable and stigma-free support. With our background in AI, neuroscience, and digital health innovation, we see an opportunity to revolutionize therapy through decentralized technology. Partnering with Polkadot aligns with our vision of creating a secure, scalable, and user-empowered mental health ecosystem.

❌ No Centralized Data Ownership: Glomood does not store user health records on traditional cloud databases—only encrypted decentralized storage solutions.
❌ Not a Trading Platform: Unlike some Web3 projects, Glomood is focused on mental health and wellness, not crypto financial services.
❌ No Medical Diagnosis: Glomood provides emotional support but does not replace professional medical advice or prescriptions.



### 🧩 Ecosystem Fit

1. Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
Glomood integrates with the Polkadot ecosystem by utilizing its decentralized identity (DID) and cross-chain interoperability to ensure secure, private, and scalable mental health support. By leveraging Polkadot’s parachain infrastructure, we enhance data privacy, transparency, and accessibility, allowing users to control their mental health data without centralized entities.

2. Who is your target audience?
Glomood primarily serves:

 - Young adults struggling with mental health who need accessible, stigma-free, and affordable support.
 - Students and early-career professionals who require mental wellness tools integrated into their daily routines.
- Blockchain & Web3 users who value privacy-preserving mental health solutions powered by decentralized technology.

3. What need(s) does your project meet?
Glomood addresses critical gaps in mental health accessibility and security, including:

Anonymity & Data Ownership: Unlike traditional therapy apps, we ensure user data remains private and decentralized.
24/7 Support: AI-powered therapy provides real-time assistance without wait times or high costs.
Global Accessibility: With multilingual and culturally adaptive therapy features, we ensure inclusivity across regions.

4. Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem?

If so, how is your project different?
While some projects in the Polkadot ecosystem focus on decentralized health data storage (e.g., Crust Network for secure storage), Glomood uniquely combines AI-powered therapy with blockchain security—a first-of-its-kind integration.

If not, why might such a project not exist yet?
The lack of AI-powered mental health solutions in the Polkadot ecosystem likely stems from:
- High barriers to AI development within decentralized networks.
- Regulatory challenges around health data privacy and compliance.
- A traditional focus on financial and infrastructure-based projects rather than human-centered applications like mental health.

> **Note**: We prioritize projects building on Plaza/Polkadot Hub, games, and DeFi applications, though all types of projects will be considered.
