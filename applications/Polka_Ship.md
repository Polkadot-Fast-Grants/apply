Freight Futures / Polka Ship

# 📝 Freight Futures Prediction Markets

## 🌟 Project Overview

FreightFutures is a prediction market for future freight prices.

In a post-tariff highly volatile period, freight prices are at an unprecedented level of volatility.

Apple is flying iPhones into the US to get them in before tariffs kick in, and freight prices could crash when they're applied. Companies need a way to hedge against this volatility, and need a derivative market to bet on their worst case outcome to dampen the loss for them.

Meanwhile, the shipping industry derivative market hasn't been catalysed yet but the value and volume is already huge, it just needs the right catalyst. And Trump provides a perfect catalyst. 

This project is to launch a prediction market for Freight Futures using Polkadot for flexibility and resilience, enabling people to bet on the future prices, and companies to hedge against their volatility. If we ride the wave today, we can make a market that lasts into the future.


We're so interested in the freight market that we'd like to build our long term career in these two spaces. Whether FreightFutures takes us all the way or not, we intend to build in shipping for life.



### 🔍 Project Details

Tech stack:
 - React, Typescript, Vite, TailwindCSS, Shadcn/UI
 - Polkadot AssetHub, SmartContracts ++

Hackathon demo: https://freightfutures.netlify.app/

Functionality:
 - Users can connect their wallet, create a prediction market (question), bet on an outcome, and have the liquidity pool released to the winner. 
 - An oracle can also submit the final answer, with a penalty for not doing so.


### 🧩 Ecosystem Fit

 - Polkadot is the best chain for a DeFi app like this, and a great case study that Polkadot can be applied to real world use cases.

 - Target audience 1 is all web3 traders, Web2 traders interested in Freight or Politics
 - We solve their need to apply real world knowledge to bet on futures and grow their capital. They will make money by supporting companies to hedge risk. 

 - Target audience 2 is Companies who need to hedge against freight price volatility.
 - We solve their need to hedge against freight price volatility by providing a market to bet on the future prices.

 - A similar project to ours is Polymarket, which is a less niche use case, but an inspirational UX to learn from.
 - No one has done this for Freight because the volatility didn't exist until this last month.

## 🔮 Future Plans

We're passionate about the Freight industry, and would like to turn this into an active ecosystem. From there, we'd like to grow the business into further Web3 use cases in Shipping.

We're actively seeking grant funding to continue development, and will use this grant funding to refine the business model to be scalable enough for VC.
