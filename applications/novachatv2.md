# üìù NovachatV2

## üåü Project Overview

- **Tagline:** Making Web3 effortless with AI-powered conversational DeFi.
- **Brief Description:**\
  NovachatV2 is an AI-driven chatbot designed for everyday users to interact with Polkadot‚Äôs EVM-compatible chains using natural language. It enables intuitive DeFi actions like checking balances, sending tokens, and trading/staking on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) by simply connecting a wallet and talking to the bot. The platform auto-executes read-only transactions and prompts MetaMask for state-changing ones, ensuring safety and ease. This grant will transform the Ethereum-based MVP into a production-ready platform with Polkadot EVM support, cloud deployment, and a polished user experience.
- **Integration with Polkadot:**\
  NovachatV2 will integrate with Polkadot‚Äôs EVM-compatible chains using Web3.js, supporting DeFi operations on two DEXs for trading and staking. It simplifies Web3 for regular users by automating tasks like adding RPC info to MetaMask.
- **Team Interest:**\
  As a serial hackathon winner and Web3 developer, I am passionate about removing barriers to DeFi adoption. NovachatV2‚Äôs conversational AI makes Polkadot‚Äôs EVM ecosystem accessible to non-technical users, empowering them to engage with Web3 effortlessly.

## üîç Project Details

- **Technology Stack:**

  - Frontend: React, TypeScript, Next.js 15+, Tailwind CSS
  - Backend: Node.js, Web3.js for blockchain interactions
  - AI: Llama 3.2 (natural language), Flock Web3 Agent Model (function calling)
  - Infrastructure: Cloud servers (AWS/GCP), WebSocket for real-time updates
  - Tools: RainbowKit for wallet integration
  - Testing: Manual testing as needed

- **Core Components:**

  1. **Conversational AI Interface:**
     - Dual-model AI: Llama 3.2 for natural language processing, Flock Web3 Agent Model for Web3 function calling.
     - Supports commands like ‚ÄúCheck my balance‚Äù or ‚ÄúSwap tokens on a DEX.‚Äù
     - Auto-executes read-only transactions (e.g., balance checks) and prompts MetaMask for state-changing ones (e.g., token transfers).
     - Highly intuitive: users connect their wallet and can perform any typical DeFi action (trading, staking, sending tokens) by chatting, with the bot handling RPC configuration and transaction prompts.
  2. **Polkadot EVM Integration:**
     - Connectivity to Polkadot EVM chains for balance queries, token transfers, and DEX interactions.
     - Automatic RPC info injection into MetaMask for seamless network switching.
  3. **Function Playground:**
     - Educational interface for users to learn Web3 mechanics by manually calling functions (e.g., send tokens, check balances) and experimenting with parameters.
     - Supports custom transaction parsing, ABI-based contract interactions, and contract deployment.
  4. **Cloud Deployment:**
     - Production-ready setup with rate limits and public access for all users.

- **Relevant Prior Work:**

  - NovachatV2 MVP (Ethereum-based) is available at https://novachat-v2.vercel.app (AI functionality not working as it‚Äôs local). It supports Uniswap trading/staking, token transfers, and balance checks on EVM networks. Codebase: https://github.com/bonusducks777/novachat-v2/tree/main.
  - Won #1 Flock and Educhain bounties at UK AI Agent Hackathon (2025), #1 BNB Chain and #2 Avalanche tracks at ETH Oxford (2024) for NovachatV1.
  - Demo: YouTube pitch (begins halfway through).

- **UI Mockups:**\
  The interface will use the same UI as the MVP at https://novachat-v2.vercel.app, featuring:

  - A chat window for user-AI interaction with suggested prompts.
  - A function playground panel for manual function calls and parameter experimentation.
  - A network switcher and wallet connection button for MetaMask integration.

- **What NovachatV2 is NOT:**

  - Not a developer-focused tool or IDE for DApp development.
  - Not a custodial wallet or key management solution.
  - Not supporting non-EVM Polkadot chains in this grant.
  - Not developing cross-chain functionality or the Web3 intro educational section.

## üß© Ecosystem Fit

- **Ecosystem Position:**\
  NovachatV2 is a user-friendly DeFi interface for Polkadot‚Äôs EVM-compatible chains, enabling everyday users to engage with Web3 without technical knowledge.
- **Target Audience:**
  - Regular users new to DeFi who want to trade, stake, or send tokens effortlessly.
  - Crypto enthusiasts seeking a simple, conversational Web3 interface.
  - Users curious about Web3 mechanics who use the function playground to learn.
- **Needs Addressed:**
  - Eliminates technical barriers by automating RPC setup and transaction prompts.
  - Simplifies DeFi tasks (trading, staking, transfers) via natural language.
  - Educates users through the playground, fostering Web3 understanding.
  - Provides a safe, intuitive platform with MetaMask prompts for security.
- **Similar Projects:**\
  No similar projects were found in the Polkadot ecosystem (based on web searches and provided documents). Existing tools like PAPI Interactive Console and ink! AIDE target developers, not regular users. NovachatV2‚Äôs conversational AI and focus on daily DeFi users are unique.

## üìä Development Status

The NovachatV2 MVP, built from scratch, supports Ethereum-based DeFi interactions (Uniswap trading/staking, token transfers, balance checks) on EVM networks. It uses Llama 3.2 for natural language and the Flock Web3 Agent Model for function calling, with wallet integration via RainbowKit. The function playground allows manual testing of some functions, though contract deployment and custom transaction parsing are incomplete. The platform runs locally with the Flock model hosted via Replicate API, causing latency. MVP link: https://novachat-v2.vercel.app (AI functionality not working as it‚Äôs local). Demo link: YouTube pitch (begins halfway through). Codebase: https://github.com/bonusducks777/novachat-v2/tree/main.

**Current Features:**

- Conversational AI for crypto discussions and Web3 actions.
- Function playground with partial functionality (balance checks, token sends, Uniswap interactions).
- Wallet integration, network switching, and MetaMask RPC updates.
