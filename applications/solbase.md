# üìù Solbase

## üåü Project Overview

**Tagline:**
The Web3 Audio-Social Super App built to Empower Collaboration, Creativity, & Financial Freedom through Music and Crypto Innovation.

**Description:**
Solbase is an audio-first, decentralized social platform enabling users to connect, create, and transact on-chain. It combines the engagement of Clubhouse, the discovery of Spotify, and the learning of Kindle, all integrated into a single, Web3-powered ecosystem.

The app prioritizes low-bandwidth accessibility, especially for users in emerging markets (Africa, South Asia, LATAM) where connectivity and power infrastructure are poor. By building on Polkadot, we leverage fast, low-cost, scalable, and interoperable infrastructure to enable audio-based social networking, on-chain tipping, tokenized audio NFTs, and community governance.

Solbase extends Polkadot‚Äôs ecosystem into the social and creator economy space. It uses Polkadot‚Äôs scalability, interoperability, and low-fee environment to power an audio-first Web3 platform where users can host live voice rooms, publish tokenized audio, and earn through on-chain tipping. Integration will leverage Substrate for smart contract logic, Polkadot.js API for wallet and identity, and on-chain governance for community moderation and voting. In doing so, Solbase becomes a human-facing entry point into the Polkadot network,  where people experience blockchain through conversation, content, and connection.

We started Solbase to make Web3 more inclusive for people, especially in regions like Africa where poor connectivity limits access to visual, data-heavy platforms. Audio is lightweight, natural, and human ‚Äî making it the perfect medium for education, community, and creativity. Solbase enables live audio rooms, podcasts, and on-chain audio ownership, while allowing users to tip creators directly using Polkadot‚Äôs low-cost network. Built on Polkadot‚Äôs interoperable and community-driven infrastructure, Solbase aims to make Web3 intuitive, open, and truly accessible to everyone.

  - **Creator Profiles:** Showcases creator details, uploaded content, and total tips  
- **Web Version (Planned):** Post-MVP phase will add dashboards and analytics for creators.  

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Limitations

The Solbase MVP will **not**:   
- Include NFT minting (planned for future releases)  
- Implement cross-chain swaps or DeFi mechanics at launch  
- Provide a public API or data indexer during the MVP phase  


### üß© Ecosystem Fit

- **Where it fits:**  
  Most Polkadot projects focus on infrastructure, DeFi, or developer tools. **Solbase** complements them by adding a social and content layer ‚Äî connecting people to those technologies through everyday use. It can integrate with identity, DeFi, and NFT parachains to enable creator verification, tipping, and cross-chain content ownership. In essence, Solbase brings a consumer-facing dimension that helps new users experience the Polkadot ecosystem beyond finance.

- **Audience:**  
  Our audience is primarily a young and vibrant generation of creators, community builders, and educators who use audio to express, connect, and grow. This includes musicians, podcasters, Web3 community managers, and educational content creators who want to reach their audiences without heavy data costs or technical complexity.  
  We also target emerging-market users and Web3 newcomers ‚Äî individuals eager to learn, share ideas, and earn through creativity but often limited by connectivity or resources. For them, Solbase offers an easy, voice-driven gateway into decentralized technology and financial empowerment.

- **Needs met:**  
  Solbase addresses three core needs:  
  - **Access:** Provides a low-bandwidth, inclusive entry into Web3 for people in regions with limited infrastructure.  
  - **Ownership:** Gives creators true control over their voice content through tokenization and on-chain royalties.  
  - **Community:** Enables users to connect, learn, and govern together through decentralized audio spaces.  
  Together, these make digital participation more open, rewarding, and human-centered.

- **Existing projects:**  
  Within the Polkadot ecosystem, **Subsocial** is the closest project to Solbase ‚Äî a decentralized social network focused on content ownership and monetization of written media. Projects like **Bit.Country** (social metaverse experiences) and **MusicDAO** (music rights and royalties) explore related areas.  
  However, there are few, if any, Polkadot projects centered on **audio-based social interaction and creator monetization**. While some address content or community, none combine real-time voice rooms, tokenized audio, tipping, and governance in a single, accessible product.  
  Such projects are rare because most Web3 efforts have focused on finance, infrastructure, and tooling rather than social or cultural experiences. Solbase fills that gap ‚Äî introducing an audio-first social layer that unites live voice conversations, podcasts, creator rewards, and learning hubs within one interoperable Web3 ecosystem.

- **How it differs:**  
  - **Subsocial** enables decentralized text-based content creation but lacks real-time, voice-driven engagement.  
  - **Bit.Country** focuses on immersive 3D metaverse experiences rather than lightweight, mobile-first social audio.  
  - **MusicDAO** tackles music royalties within a niche vertical, not community-led voice content.  
  **Solbase** stands apart by merging voice interaction, content tokenization, community governance, and micro-economies into one inclusive platform that thrives even in low-connectivity regions.  
  This positions Solbase as the **first audio-social bridge for Polkadot**, connecting millions of new users ‚Äî especially creators and digital communities ‚Äî to Web3 through the simplicity of sound.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Information

In 2023, **Solbase** participated in the **Solana Summer Camp Hackathon** organized by **DoraHacks**, one of the largest global Web3 developer competitions. We presented **Solbase DApp** ‚Äî a social audio platform merging communication, education, and decentralized finance through voice.  

The project stood out for its **audio-first, low-bandwidth approach**, designed to help users in regions with limited connectivity access knowledge, create content, and transact using crypto efficiently.  

**Solbase earned 3rd place**, receiving a **$6,000 starter fund in SOL** and recognition for its innovation and user-centered design. The exposure led to valuable advisory relationships with members of the **Solana** and **DoraHacks** communities.  

This achievement validated Solbase‚Äôs vision and the team‚Äôs capability to design, build, and deliver meaningful decentralized applications. We are now expanding on that foundation by integrating **Polkadot‚Äôs scalable and interoperable infrastructure** to power creator tipping, wallet generation, and audio content tokenization.

The **current Polkadot version** of Solbase is being developed by the **Solbase Core Team**, led by **Emmanuel P. Charles** (Blockchain & Mobile Engineer) and **Damilola Olayiwola** (Product Designer & Strategist).  
While we have received guidance from mentors and advisors, **no external teams** have contributed directly to this phase.

To date, Solbase has only received the **$6,000 hackathon starter fund** from DoraHacks and has **not applied for any other grants or VC funding** related to this project.  
This **Fast Grant** application represents our **first formal ecosystem funding request**, aimed at advancing Solbase from MVP to a fully integrated Polkadot-powered product.

We view the Fast Grant as a **strategic first step** in evolving Solbase into a **flagship social audio protocol** within the Polkadot ecosystem ‚Äî demonstrating how Web3 can empower **human connection, creativity, and community through sound.**
