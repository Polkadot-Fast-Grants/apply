## üåü Project Overview

### One Minute Pitch

- [OnboardAI Pitch](https://www.loom.com/share/025b9734fdeb44abac453b4e5f09c566?sid=b3263b64-c19e-4a37-a0d5-8a3697f83443)

### One Sentence Summary

OnboardAI is a multilingual, on-chain AI-powered Telegram and WhatsApp agent that simplifies Web3 onboarding for first-time users of Polkadot in emerging markets.

### Brief Description

OnboardAI is a multilingual, AI-powered Telegram/WhatsApp agent that simplifies Web3 onboarding for first-time users in emerging markets. By combining 24/7 AI guidance with human expertise, it reduces scams, bridges knowledge gaps, and drives adoption of the Polkadot ecosystem through explaining its tools in plain terms and directs users to dApps, such as wallets. By reducing complexity, eliminating barriers to entry, and increasing security awareness, OnboardAI aligns with Polkadot‚Äôs mission to democratize blockchain access while creating a trustless, user-centric onboarding layer.

OnboardAI is a multilingual AI chatbot that simplifies crypto onboarding by offering real-time guidance and scam protection via WhatsApp and Telegram. Built for mobile-first users in emerging markets, it introduces Polkadot tools and staking flows conversationally and accessibly. It includes plain-language explainers, localisation, and optional mentoring by humans.

### Why Polkadot?

OnboardAI integrates Polkadot-native content like wallet setup, staking, governance, and parachains into a messaging-first assistant. Ethereum never really took off in emerging markets and we believe Polkadot can and should fill this gap. OnboardAI helps non-technical users understand and engage with the ecosystem in real time and provides the Polkadot team insights in onboarding pain points and reasons for user churn.

### Team Motivation

We are passionate about inclusive UX and believe that Polkadot‚Äôs modular multi-chain architecture must be made approachable for a mobile-first, global audience. Our team has decades of combined experience in Web3 and DAOs. Instead of building for crypto twitter, we want to create real-world impact, which we missed while delivering DAO tooling to Nouns Builder, building RPC infrastructure to Taiko, or creating B2B Web3 applications funded by the European Union.

## üîç Project Details

### Technical Architecture

### Limitations

- OnboardAI is not a wallet or bridge; it does not perform financial transactions.  
- Not an app; the core experience is messaging-first.

## üß© Ecosystem Fit

OnboardAI reduces psychological and technical barriers for mobile-first users entering Web3. While there is [https://polkabot.ai/](https://polkabot.ai/), it does not meet new entrants where they are at and is targeted at more advanced users. The considerations leading to the selection of Polkadot as an ecosystem for launch can be summarised as follows:

- **Target Audience:** Crypto-curious users aged 18‚Äì35 in underbanked, mobile-first regions (Africa, SEA, LatAm). Especially first-time wallet users and non-English speakers.  
- **Needs Addressed:**  
  - Reduces onboarding friction  
  - Builds confidence in interacting with Polkadot-native dApps  
  - Detects scams and improves user trust  
- **Similar Projects:**  
  - Polkadot community bots exist, but none offer real-time, multilingual onboarding via Telegram/WhatsApp with Polkadot-specific education and mentoring.  
- **Why It Doesn‚Äôt Exist Yet:** Most onboarding flows assume browser-based users or desktop access. This leaves behind emerging markets where messaging apps dominate.

By embedding Polkadot-native education into messaging apps, it builds confidence through conversation-based learning. It supports Polkadot on-chain economy by:

- Increasing first-time wallet setups through guided flows  
- Boosting dApp visibility within user learning journeys  
- Surfacing onboarding data to improve UX and content  
- Reducing drop-off with plain-language explainers and scam alerts  
- Enabling equitable access via localised flows for Africa, SE Asia, and LATAM  
- Building trust at first contact, improving conversion

OnboardAI also provides real-time insights into user needs, giving Polkadot ecosystem teams a feedback loop previously missing from messaging-first regions.

## üìä Development Status

Prototype development for OnboardAI has commenced and we are looking to use this grant for releasing an MVP and testing it with alpha users. The opportunity space for the solution has been thoroughly researched through desk research, stakeholder interviews, and product design sessions. Outcomes of this research phase are outlined below.

### What‚Äôs the product about? What problem are you aiming to solve?

Most newcomers abandon crypto due to confusion, scams, and poor UX. OnboardAI meets users on WhatsApp and Telegram, offering real-time, plain-language guidance, including Polkadot-specific knowledge. It targets mobile-first users in MENA, SEA, and LATAM ‚Äì regions with high adoption potential but limited support. Users learn how to set up wallets, bridge tokens, and use dApps through conversational AI, with optional access to human coaches. Features include Polkadot-native content, scam alerts, and localisation. This low-barrier, high-reach format enables safe onboarding without app downloads. OnboardAI builds trust at first contact and drives adoption where it matters most. Future insights dashboards will help partners, such as Polkadot teams optimizing their local-first market acquisition and retention approach.

Most newcomers abandon crypto due to confusion, poor UX, and scams. OnboardAI solves this by meeting users where they are (WhatsApp, Telegram), explaining crypto basics in plain language, and helping them start their Web3 journey securely. Polkadot-specific content highlights fast, low-cost interactions and Polkadot-native projects.

#### Problem

Most Web3 onboarding tools are still designed for desktop-native, crypto-savvy users. Newcomers in emerging markets, however, are mobile-first or mobile-only, face language, interface, and trust barriers with scams on messaging platforms being widespread. While Web3 is too entrenched in infrastructure development and institutional adoption, the promise of crypto as a store of value and a means to transact is lost on the next billion users. Users in emerging markets need to understand today how crypto can complement or replace workarounds of the unbanked, for example M-Pesa. OnboardAI helps users navigate crypto and supports them in their journey to access a global, low-cost financial system that does not rely on local fiat currencies.

#### Solution Approach

OnboardAI is a messaging-first onboarding assistant designed to guide new users through the complexities of Web3 in a familiar, conversational format. Delivered via WhatsApp and Telegram, it provides 24/7 AI-powered support to answer common questions, like how to set up a wallet, bridge assets, or interact with a dApp on Polkadot, while offering premium access to human coaches for more personalised help. This hybrid model ensures accessibility, trust, and depth, all within platforms users already rely on daily.

##### Features

* **Education and Coaching:** Plain-language guidance on common Web3 tasks, tailored for beginners. *What is the best wallet for Polkadot? How do I use a bridge? What is Substrate?*  
* **Mentorship:** Human coaching on-demand, payable via crypto or local payment methods.  
* **Local Communities:** Find Web3 peers and supporters nearby.  
* **On-chain integration:** Swap tokens, track gas fees, and bridge assets within chat.  
* **Emerging markets focus:** Initial rollout targets LATAM, Southeast Asia, and MENA with localised tone and content.  
* **Engagement Rewards:** A lightweight, opt-in points system will reward users for asking questions, tracking learning progress, and eventually unlocking perks ‚Äì a gamified learning journey.

By making onboarding conversational, localised, and always accessible, OnboardAI meets users where they are, on their phones, in familiar chat apps, and enables a safe, progressive introduction to Polkadot.

While the chatbot experience is user-led, every interaction is a potential on-ramp to Polkadot. Our goal is to support users for whom Polkadot‚Äôs features, scalability, ecosystem reach, low cost, align with real-world use cases, such as mobile-first access to savings, gaming, or remittances.

In future phases, OnboardAI will empower Polkadot ecosystem partners by offering a data insights dashboard that surfaces onboarding trends and user pain points in real time. For example, a wallet team could view insights like ‚ÄúTop questions from LATAM this week‚Äù or ‚ÄúSpike in bridging confusion ‚Üí opportunity for guided tutorial.‚Äù These insights will help Polkadot-native builders localise strategy and plug into conversations where user curiosity begins.

### Why now is the right time for this product?

Polkadot is positioned to lead Web3 adoption in emerging markets like Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, where mobile-first users rely on WhatsApp as their primary messaging app. Existing Web3-native tools do not capture user growth in these regions and we need to lower onboarding barriers for first-time users.

OnboardAI meets this need with a multilingual, conversational onboarding assistant embedded directly in messaging apps. It allows users to chat their way into Web3, building trust and confidence without needing prior crypto knowledge.

This is a time-sensitive opportunity. Competitors are moving to capture emerging markets, but few offer localised, first-contact education. Funding OnboardAI now enables Polkadot to reach the next billion users, secure regional market share, and become the most human-centric and accessible Layer 2 before user habits and loyalties are formed elsewhere.

### Who is your target audience? How big is the target market?

Our target audience is mobile-first Web3 newcomers in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia who use WhatsApp/Telegram daily. This is a segment of over 1 billion active users across messaging apps. Our initial niche is curious but overwhelmed users aged 18-35 in underbanked regions.

## üìÖ Development Roadmap

### Milestone 01: UX Research

The onboarding experience is studied across our core markets. User interviews and journey maps surface knowledge needs and user experience preferences. Personas are created to reflect typical user behaviours and pain points. A clickable demo is built to show key conversation flows and interactions and used for further iteration.

### üîÆ Future Plans

Beyond the grand period, OnboardAI will evolve into the default onboarding tool for Web3 adoption, empowering users globally to explore and engage with decentralised technologies safely and confidently. 

While our initial deployment focuses on the Polkadot ecosystem, our long-term vision is inherently multi-chain. We aim to connect with leading protocols, wallets, and ecosystems across chains to build a cross-chain education assistant that avoids bias and lock-in. Offering a broad selection of ecosystems and use cases, we want to ensure that users retain freedom of choice, which is a core principle of Web3. 

Inspired by educational platforms like Duolingo or Uxcel, we will introduce gamified learning paths, badge systems, and community leaderboards to incentivise engagement and user retention. As adoption grows, OnboardAI will become a data-driven insights platform for other ecosystem builders through surfacing main onboarding pain points and regional trends.

## Our roadmap

* Expand OnboardAI to support all major Polkadot parachains with specific onboarding flows  
* Launch reward system to gamify user learning and improve retention  
* Explore integration with Subscan and on-chain interaction APIs  
* Expanded chain integrations, enabling users to interact with diverse dApps, DeFi protocols, and NFT platforms across chains.  
* Gamified learning experiences, turning complex Web3 topics into engaging, bite-sized challenges ‚Äì think *Duolingo for crypto*.  
* Localised agents, to reach non-English-speaking users across LATAM, Africa, and Southeast Asia.  
* Community-driven knowledge base, where power users can contribute insights, translations, or mentorship and earn rewards.  
* Onboarding-as-a-service for dApps, allowing ecosystem partners to integrate OnboardAI into their platforms as a plug-and-play support layer.  
* Expansion to other chat platforms popular in the non-Western context like Line, Kakao Talk.
