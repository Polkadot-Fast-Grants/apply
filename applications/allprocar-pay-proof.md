Application: Allprocar Pay & Proof – Real-World Crypto Payments on Polkadot
# 🧩 Allprocar Pay & Proof  
**Category:** Real-World Adoption / Payments / Web3 Reputation  
**Applicant:** Allprocar SAS (Mendoza, Argentina)  
**Grant type:** Polkadot Fast Grant

## 🧠 Overview
**Allprocar Pay & Proof** is a Web3 module that enables **real-world crypto payments and on-chain service reputation** within the automotive post-sale industry.  
It allows car owners in Latin America to **pay for repairs, towing, and maintenance directly with DOT or stablecoins**, while every verified transaction automatically generates a **blockchain record of trust (Proof NFT)** linked to the vehicle’s VIN and the certified workshop.

This project bridges Polkadot with a tangible, high-frequency use case — **turning crypto into daily utility** for millions of vehicle owners and service providers.

---

## 🧩 Problem
The automotive after-sales market in LATAM is **massive yet outdated**.  
It remains mostly cash-based, lacks traceability, and customers have no secure way to pay or verify the quality of services.  
At the same time, **crypto adoption in the region is rising**, but without **real-world utilities** like vehicle maintenance or local services.

Workshops don’t have transparent reputations or verified records, and customers can’t pay with DOT or stablecoins in a safe, trust-based environment.

---

## 💡 Solution
Allprocar Pay & Proof integrates a **Polkadot-based payment and reputation protocol** directly into the Allprocar platform.

- Car owners can **pay with DOT, USDT, or other Substrate-based tokens** for services like mechanical repair, towing, or part replacement.  
- Each completed service triggers an **on-chain Proof NFT**, containing the VIN hash, service details, timestamp, and provider ID.  
- The system uses an **escrow and split-payment contract** to securely distribute funds between workshops and parts suppliers.  
- Every transaction strengthens a **transparent reputation network** for the automotive ecosystem.

This creates a bridge between **Web3 infrastructure and daily automotive transactions**, giving Polkadot a visible, human-scale use case.
