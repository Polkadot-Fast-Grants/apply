# üìù Petidot

## üåü Project Overview


- **Tagline:** Train, evolve, and explore with your NFT pets on Polkadot.
- PetiDot is an idle blockchain game I built where players can mint unique NFT pets, train them through staking, and send them on adventures to earn rewards. Each pet evolves through age stages, with attributes like rarity, type, and customizable names‚Äîmaking every NFT personal and progression-driven.
- The game is built on the Polkadot Asset Hub, using its smart contract capabilities to manage NFTs and staking mechanics. Future plans include cross-parachain features like pet trading, minigames and more secure randomness.
- I'm a solo developer passionate about web3 gaming. I created PetiDot to show how fun and user-friendly blockchain experiences can be, and Polkadot‚Äôs infrastructure made it the ideal choice for scalability, low fees, and innovation.

### üîç Project Details

- **Tech Stack:**  
  PetiDot is built using Solidity for smart contracts, deployed on the Polkadot Asset Hub Westend Testnet. The frontend is developed in React and communicates with the chain using Ethers.js. The app is deployed on Cloudflare Pages for fast and reliable delivery.

- **Architecture & Core Components:**  
  - **Smart Contracts:** Handle NFT minting, staking (training), metadata management, and reward logic.
  - **Frontend:** A React-based UI that interfaces with the contracts via Ethers.js, with wallet connection and user-friendly interactions.
  - **Wallet Integration:** Uses MetaMask and compatible wallets for seamless interaction with the Asset Hub.

- **PoC/MVP:**  
  A functional MVP is live at [https://petidot.pages.dev](https://petidot.pages.dev). It includes:
  - NFT minting with randomized attributes
  - Pet staking mechanics (training)
  - Age progression logic
  - Rename functionality
  - UI for interacting with and displaying NFT metadata
- **Mockups/Designs:**  
  The UI is intentionally lightweight and inspired by classic idle games. While no Figma files were created, the live MVP demonstrates the intended design system.
- **Data Models / API Specifications:**  
  - **NFT Metadata Schema:**
    - `id` (uint256): Token ID
    - `name` (string): Customizable pet name
    - `type` (string): Visual/type variation
    - `rarity` (string): Trait rarity
    - `ageStage` (uint8): Evolution stage
    - `isStaked` (bool): Training status
  - All interactions are on-chain with no backend APIs; metadata is handled directly within the contract.
- **What the Project is *Not* / Will *Not* Include:**  
  - PvP, battle mechanics, or advanced competitive gameplay
  - Off-chain game logic or backend server infrastructure

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

- **Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?**  
  PetiDot brings casual, NFT-driven gaming to the Polkadot ecosystem by leveraging the Polkadot Asset Hub for smart contract execution and NFT management. It showcases the versatility of the network beyond financial applications by introducing a gamified and approachable Web3 experience. Future features will also use Polkadot‚Äôs XCM to fetch randomness cross-chain‚Äîdemonstrating a real use case for cross-parachain communication in gaming.

- **Who is your target audience?**  
  I'm targeting casual gamers, NFT collectors, and newcomers to Web3 who might find traditional blockchain apps too complex or intimidating. PetiDot is designed to be fun, intuitive, and rewarding‚Äîeven for those who have never played a blockchain game before.

- **What need(s) does your project meet?**  
  PetiDot makes Web3 more approachable and engaging through simple gameplay mechanics and evolving NFT pets. It introduces users to staking, randomness, and on-chain progression in a low-risk, gamified environment. I'm planning to expand the game with a token reward system: players will participate in mini-games, and if they win, they'll earn tokens‚Äîrandomly weighted based on their NFT‚Äôs attributes. These tokens can then be used to open crates with cosmetic upgrades or future gameplay items.

- **Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem?**  
  I haven‚Äôt seen other live casual games on the Polkadot Asset Hub with idle mechanics, evolving NFTs, and mini-game-based token rewards tied to cross-chain randomness.

  - **How is your project different?**  
    PetiDot blends simplicity with depth by tying gameplay rewards to NFT traits, creating a personal and progression-driven experience. Planned use of Polkadot‚Äôs XCM to pull in cross-parachain randomness for fair token distribution also makes this more than a standalone game‚Äîit‚Äôs a demonstration of Polkadot‚Äôs core tech in action.

  - **Why might such a project not exist yet?**  
    Many Polkadot projects focus on infrastructure, DeFi, or just NFT collections. Casual solo gameplay often gets overlooked, despite its potential for onboarding and ecosystem education. I built PetiDot to fill that space‚Äîeasy to use, fun to play, and designed to evolve over time with the ecosystem‚Äôs capabilities.

## üîÆ Future Plans

After the Fast-Grant, I plan to focus on growing a strong community around PetiDot. The first step will be to build out the project's social media presence and start engaging with early supporters. I‚Äôll be running a token airdrop campaign to help spread awareness and onboard new users into the ecosystem.

As the community grows, I‚Äôll continue expanding the world of PetiDot by introducing new pet types and character variants to keep the experience fresh and engaging. I also plan to add more simple and fun mini-games to increase interactivity and give users more ways to engage with their NFT pets.

To support these growth initiatives, I intend to seek additional funding specifically to scale the airdrop and community-building efforts. My long-term goal is to position PetiDot as a fun and welcoming entry point into the Polkadot ecosystem‚Äîaccessible for newcomers, yet built on powerful technology that showcases the strengths of Polkadot Asset Hub.

My vision for PetiDot is to create an approachable and playful gateway into the Polkadot ecosystem‚Äîsomething that lowers the barrier for new users while still showcasing Polkadot's capabilities.
