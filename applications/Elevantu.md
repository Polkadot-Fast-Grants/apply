## 🌟 Project Overview

![Logo_Spin-ezgif com-resize](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89bba8e4-af0b-4fd1-bd32-fe64c0fa0759)

**Tagline:** World First Web3-powered Confidence Gym

**Brief Description:** 
Elevantu is a privacy-first behavioural coaching platform designed to help shy entrepreneurs build confidence through real world challenges and consistent social actions. Users engage in daily missions and log their progress. - All while preserving anonymity. Think Rejection Therapy Challenges x Duolingo x Skool Community.

**Integration with Polkadot:**
Elevantu is not just built on Polkadot — it is architecturally and philosophically aligned with Polkadot. Polkadot enables us to:

✅ Create a privacy-preserving behavioral system
✅ Interact across roll-ups as a reputation oracle 

✅ Evolve on our own terms with upgradeable logic
✅ Engage with users who value meaning over speculation

**Team Interest:**
My first ever web3 hackathon was with you guys two years ago, no-one wanted me on their team and I froze on stage but that started my journey. Since then I've competed in over 25 hackathons across three continents and over time I developed a protocol for how to attract talent and brute force learnt how to present to 300+ people with ease and charisma. The repeatable protocol continues to unlock my authentic personality and it is so valuable I want to share it with other founders who feel they are held back by social anxiety like I was. I've solved my own problem and have condensed two years of wisdom into an easily digestable 'game'.

### 🔍 Project Details
 
**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js/react 
- **Smart Contracts:** EVM-compatible contracts, Westend Asset Hub for challenge submission and NFT minting
- **Wallet integration:** MetaMask
- **Storage:** Browser localStorage for journal reflections
- **Deployment:** Custom domain already purchased

**Core Components:**
- **Frontend Pages:** Home, Warm-Up Timer, Journal (Reflections), Profile
- **Smart Contract:** Tracks challenges completed, mints NFTs
- **Challenge Calibration Tool:** Assigns starting point based on user experience and comfort.
- **Journal System:** Saves reflections locally
  
1. **Frontend Pages:**
* **Home** page will display daily challenge, total challenges completed, streaks and the nav bar to the other pages.
* The **Warm-up** page will have a checklist for warm-up challenges that can be ticked off and a timer integrated so 'lap times' between reps can be calculated.
* **Journal** will be the center of all recorded reflections on the challenges supporting both text and audio.
* **Profile** will display any achievement NFTs the user has gained and will also be where the challenge calibration tool will be accessed. 

2. **Smart Contract:**
* **logCompletion()**: Logs a challenge done by the user (multiple allowed per day, only counts the day once).
  
* **getTotalDaysCompleted(address)**: Returns how many distinct days the user has completed at least one challenge

* **getCurrentStreak(address)**: Returns the user’s current streak (consecutive days with completions).

3. **Challenge Calibration Tool:** For user comfort it is important to allign their rejection challenge schedule with their initial comfort zone. At the minute the plan is to create a form which distills their comfort level and assigns them an corresponding starting point which stretches them but not enough to intimidate them completely. 

4. **Journal System:** One of the main painpoints of my current impractical work flow is that all my journalling is dispersed, in untitled voicenotes without transcripts an therefore search capability, just stored somewhere. The aim with this component is to have appended reflection media, text or audio for now, to the challenge it refers to, or in regards to performance comments based on the whole session. 


**Mock-Up:**
This is only a quick chatgpt mockup based on the pages required on the dapp.

**What We Are Not Building:**
* No backend server for journal storage (privacy-first local browser storage)
* No mobile app (only responsive web app for now)
* No complex multi-chain asset transfers (single-chain NFT achievements)
* Not a social media network to get clout through social stunts
* Users will not be encouraged to film their rejection therapy challenges, videos wont be accepted for journalling purposes


### 🧩 Ecosystem Fit

**Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?**
- To be honest, this will belong in a novel intersection between gaming and self-improvement. Social prowess is something you cannot purchase, but it can be developed like a muscle. So this is like a bespoke social ability training plan, but the difference between this and some generated pdf is the central aspect of gamifying the process. With badges of completion and streak accomplishments which signify and imply a particular level of competency. 

**Who is your target audience?**
It will change over time as the company matures, for now my niche will be - Web3 entrepreneurs and c-suite raising their seed, angel investment or series A, and feel like their social ability could be enhanced. Over time this will grow to accomodate other sectors, starting with the wider tech industry and then adjacent industries.
* Entrepreneurs, professionals, and salespeople seeking to improve their social confidence
* Rejection Therapy and self-improvement enthusiasts
* High-net-worth individuals willing to invest in measurable personal growth
* Polkadot community members interested in verifiable off-chain achievements

**What needs does your project meet? Why are there not competitors**
We meet three unmet needs:
1) To onboard the world we need bold and socially adept web3 leaders - I havent heard of any bespoke training programs designed specifically to improve confidence specifically for web3 entrepreneurs.

2) Trustworthy proof of personal growth — Existing bootcamps and confidence programs (web2) lack transparent, verifiable records of participation and effort.

3) Reputation and accountability in self-improvement — Publicly visible, on-chain records incentivize long-term engagement and build a reputation layer for users’ consistency and discipline.

There are currently no direct competitors because the combination of elements we're bringing together—confidence-building challenges for entrepreneurs, powered by Web3—doesn’t exist in this specific form yet. While there are platforms for self-improvement, personal development, or even rejection therapy in a more generalized form, none are tailored to the entrepreneurial community or have successfully leveraged blockchain to create an incentivized ecosystem with the focus on real-world, business-specific challenges that Elevantu offers.

## 📊 Development Status

The foundation of this project emerged from extensive real-world testing of rejection therapy challenges as a means to rapidly build entrepreneurial confidence. Originally derived from vocal warm-up exercises before hackathon pitches and startup presentations, these challenges evolved into a structured, repeatable procedure for reducing social anxiety, improving communication skills and enlarge ones comfort zone, Quickly. 

To be clear this isnt a infantile social experiment project, although unconventional, I have personally found this to be the most effective method to quickly improve public speaking, negotiation, handling rejection, and networking skills. Critical skills of an entrepreneur.

Over the past year, I’ve documented and refined these challenges through consistent content creation—recording video demonstrations, sharing guides to my close friends, and sharing insights with entrepreneurial communities. This groundwork validates both the feasibility and demand for a scalable, systematic approach to confidence-building, which Elevantu now aims to bring on-chain with a dapp that can ease frictions I have with my current workflow.

## 🔮 Future Plans

* Personally continue performing rejection therapy challenges and grow my comfort zone extensively
* Organically growing a social media presence will take minimum 6 months of regular posting I suspect, will use repurpose.io to automate posting across all socials with a post schedule. 
* Onboard people I meet at hackathons, conferences and hostels
* Commence 1-1 consultations and build mentoring expertise 
* Hold Bootcamps where I physically accompany students with their challenges
* Either integrate further into polkadot as a confidence layer where the streak NFTs signify special access/perks OR expand vertically with pitching/raising capital specific exercises/bootcamps. This will depend on the user feedback through the first 6 months of development.
* I want this to affect the creators of the protocols and roll-ups on polkadot, if I can help improve the communication ability of web3 leaders then that has a disproportionate influence on the industry as a whole.
