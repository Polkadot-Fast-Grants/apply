# üìù Trady - Polkadot OTC Marketplace

## üåü Project Overview

- **Tagline:** A decentralized over-the-counter (OTC) marketplace for large-volume asset trading across Polkadot parachains
- **Description:** Trady is a trustless, peer-to-peer OTC trading platform built exclusively on Polkadot, enabling users to trade large amounts of assets without slippage while leveraging Polkadot's cross-chain interoperability for seamless multi-parachain asset swaps
- **Polkadot Integration:** Built as a Substrate-based parachain utilizing Polkadot's XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging) for cross-chain asset transfers and shared security model
- **Team Interest:** We believe Polkadot's unique architecture provides the perfect foundation for building truly interoperable DeFi solutions, and OTC trading represents a significant gap in the current ecosystem that can drive institutional adoption

### üîç Project Details

- **Technology Stack:**
  - Blockchain: Polkadot Substrate framework
  - Smart Contracts: ink! for contract logic
  - Frontend: React.js with Polkadot.js integration
  - Cross-chain: XCM for parachain communication
  - Testing: Rococo/Westend testnet, then Polkadot mainnet deployment

- **Core Components:**
  - Order matching engine with escrow functionality
  - Cross-chain asset bridge integration
  - Reputation and dispute resolution system
  - Privacy-preserving trade execution

- **Prior Work:** Initial prototype available at [trady.vercel.app](https://trady.vercel.app) demonstrating basic UI/UX concepts

- **UI/UX Design:** Clean, institutional-grade interface focusing on large trade management, order books, and cross-chain asset selection

- **What Trady Will NOT Provide:**
  - Automated market making or liquidity pools
  - High-frequency trading capabilities
  - Centralized custody services
  - Fiat on/off ramps

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

- **Ecosystem Position:** Fills the institutional trading gap in Polkadot's DeFi landscape by providing dedicated OTC infrastructure
- **Target Audience:** Institutional traders, high-net-worth individuals, DAOs, and large token holders requiring slippage-free trading
- **Needs Addressed:** Large volume trading without market impact, cross-parachain asset swaps, privacy-preserving institutional trades
- **Competitive Analysis:** While platforms like Acala and Equilibrium provide AMM-based trading, no dedicated OTC marketplace exists in the Polkadot ecosystem, creating a clear opportunity for institutional adoption
