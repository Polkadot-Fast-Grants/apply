## **Name**

Nemo: Cross-chain AI Persona Protocol

## **Tagline**

Your on-chain trading behavior. Your AI twin. Powered by personality — shaped by MBTI, styled by your trades.

**## Project Overview**

Nemo is a protocol that transforms multichain wallet behavior into a personality-powered AI chatbot. By analyzing DeFi, NFT, DAO, and governance actions across Polkadot parachains, Nemo mints  NFT-based AI personas that users can interact with, customize, and monetize. These AI agents reflect each wallet's on-chain personality and evolve over time.

## **Project Details**

- Frontend: Web app using Polkadot.js (React + Typescript)
- Backend: Behavior aggregation service and LLM-powered persona engine
- Smart Contracts: ink! / pallet contracts for MBTI-style persona NFTs, access control, and payment logic
- Storage: IPFS + Arweave for personality snapshot storage
- Cross-chain: Uses XCMP to fetch behavioral data from Moonbeam, Acala, Astar; stores NFTs on AssetHub

Key Features:

- AI chatbot agents shaped by wallet behavior and MBTI
- Soulbound evolving persona NFTs stored on AssetHub
- Personality-based monetization: users can pay to talk to others' agents
- Visual layers, meme sharing, and leaderboard for gamification

## **Ecosystem Fit**

Nemo fits squarely within Polkadot's identity, multichain, and social layer ambitions. It leverages AssetHub for persistent identity, XCMP for multichain data, and brings fun, social, and non-financial utility into the ecosystem. Nemo also introduces a new model of chain-native creator economy by letting users monetize their behavioral identity.

- Built and shipped projects using soulbound NFTs, and crypto social tooling
- Strong product, frontend, smart contract, and community experience

## **Development Status**&#x20;

- We built the basic idea of Nemo in the Consensys Hackathon and won the Polkadot's prize. Now we have pivoted the product towards a more community-facing and fun-driven direction.

Requested Grant Amount: **$10,000** (buffer included for unforeseen infrastructure or contract deployment costs)

**Deliverables 0a–0d**

- 0a. License: Apache 2.0
- 0b. Documentation: Inline code docs and user tutorial
- 0c. Testing: Unit test coverage for NFT contracts and backend logic; guide included
- 0d. Article: Medium post or blog summarizing milestones and insights

**Future Plans**
After the fast grant:

- Expand to full production MVP
- Reach out to greater Polkadot's community and run campagins to gain more traction
- Launch community campaign around personality memes and leaderboards
- Integrate with governance tools, DAO identity modules, and other parachains

**Additional Information** Nemo redefines on-chain identity using behavior, psychology, and playful design. Our long-term vision is to create a social-financial protocol where chain-native personas can interact, trade, and evolve. This is just the first step.
