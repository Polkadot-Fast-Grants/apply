## üåü Project Overview

- **Tagline:** *Test your intelligence and earn Polkadot ‚Äî play to think, earn to win.*
- **Description:** IQ-Games is an online gaming platform that challenges users to test their intelligence through engaging games such as time-based quizzes, dice outcome prediction, and word scramblers. Players earn rewards in Polkadot for their performance.
- **Relation to Polkadot:** The platform allows users to fund their in-game wallet using Polkadot (DOT) and get rewarded in DOT upon successful gameplay. It promotes DOT adoption through gaming.
- **Why this project?** I‚Äôm passionate about building an ecosystem where users can have fun while testing their intellect and earning crypto rewards. IQ-Games combines gamification, education, and blockchain incentives to bring utility and engagement to the Polkadot ecosystem.

## üîç Project Details

- **Tech Stack:**
  - Frontend: Bootstrap, jQuery
  - Backend: PHP (custom framework), MariaDB
- **Architecture Overview:**
  - Web-based game interface with REST APIs for gameplay logic, wallet funding, and reward disbursement.
  - Admin dashboard for managing games, questions, and user accounts.
- **PoC / MVP:** A basic working prototype exists for all three games, with initial UI and scoring logic.
- **UI Designs:** Current UI is Bootstrap-based and mobile responsive.
- **API Spec / Data Model:** RESTful endpoints handle authentication, game logic, wallet transactions, and reward allocation.
- **What the project will not do:**
  - It will not include real-money gambling.
  - No NFT or metaverse components are planned in this phase.

## üß© Ecosystem Fit
