**Bastion Protocol**

## üåü Project Overview

**Tagline:** Community-powered savings and lending with embedded identity and rewards on Polkadot.

**Brief Description:**  
Bastion Protocol is a **community finance super-wallet** built on Polkadot Asset Hub with native USDC support. It allows small groups to form circles for **pooled savings, micro-lending, and dynamic rewards**, underpinned by decentralized identity and reputation. Users can save, borrow, and earn together in a frictionless mobile-first app.

**Polkadot Integration:**  
- Built natively on **Polkadot Asset Hub** with USDC.  
- Smart contracts in **ink!**, with optional cross-chain messaging (XCM) for extensions.  
- Identity verification via **KILT Protocol**.  
- Rewards as **NFTs on Asset Hub** or **Unique Network**.  

**Team Interest:**  
We‚Äôve experienced firsthand the pain of fragmented community finance tools (informal lending circles, ROSCAs, and migrant remittances). Bastion Protocol is our attempt to bring these global use cases to Polkadot, powered by secure, interoperable, and user-friendly primitives.

### üîç Project Details

- **Technology Stack**:  
  - **Frontend:** Next.js + TailwindCSS (mobile-first PWA)  
  - **Wallet Integration:** SubWallet SDK / walt.id embedded wallet  
  - **Smart Contracts:** ink! v6.x on Asset Hub-compatible parachain  
  - **Database:** Supabase (for off-chain metadata & reputation tracking)  
  - **Identity:** KILT Protocol for verifiable credentials  
  - **Rewards:** NFT issuance via Asset Hub / Unique Network

- **Core Components:**  
  1. Circle creation & pooled savings contracts  
  2. Micro-lending logic (loan requests, repayments, caps)  
  3. Reputation scoring (on-chain + off-chain hybrid)  
  4. Rewards module (NFT badges + points)  

- **PoC/MVP:**  
  Initial MVP will allow:  
  - Create/join a circle  
  - Deposit USDC into shared pool  
  - Request and repay micro-loans  
  - Receive NFT reward on successful repayment

- **What Bastion Protocol is not:**  
  - Not a high-yield DeFi product (focus on community utility)  
  - Not a DAO treasury management suite  
  - Not a crypto exchange

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

- **Fit in Ecosystem:** Bastion Protocol bridges real-world community finance needs (savings circles, migrant remittances, student lending clubs) into Polkadot via Asset Hub.  
- **Target Audience:** Students, migrant workers, village/community co-ops, and DAOs seeking lightweight credit/savings solutions.  
- **Needs Met:** Trustworthy community savings & lending with embedded wallets and verifiable credentials.  
- **Differentiation:** Unlike existing DeFi lending markets (Parallel, Acala), Bastion Protocol focuses on **small circles + social trust + DID-based reputation**. No direct equivalent exists in Polkadot today.
