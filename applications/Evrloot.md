## ðŸŽ‰ tl;dr
Evrloot is a Polkadot success story. Yet web3 gaming crumbles before our eyes, and so do we. We are in a strategic pause; everyone is working for free. But we can't pay the operational server cost and risk shutting down the game. This is what we would like to address with your help until we successfully secure funding.

## ðŸ”Ž Project Overview

Evrloot is a browser-based dark fantasy RPG built on Polkadotâ€™s Moonbeam chain. Since its launch, Evrloot has:

- Recorded over **1.5M total on-chain transactions** on Polkadot.
- Reached roughly **10,600 players in 2025**.
- Grown a **fiercely loyal community**, recognized by ecosystem leaders.
- Generated **~$15,000 marketplace fees** in a short test phase, validating the economic feasibility of our ethical model without needing a Token.

### Evrloot is the Polkadot-native game
Evrloot started as a passion project of internet strangersâ€”and advanced to a beautiful Polkaot success story. It is now the flagship blockchain game built natively on the Polkadot ecosystem, representing the most successful gaming application directly built on Polkadot to date. As the **Polkadot Native Game**, Evrloot has proven its market fit with thousands of active players, dominating transaction charts on Moonbeam and Polkadot throughout multiple successful seasons. Just the share of how often Evrloot was mentioned in the Kusamarian shows the pace at which Evrloot was developing. 
Evrloot was built from the ground up specifically for the Polkadot ecosystem, starting with RMRK NFTs on Kusama in 2021. We migrated to Moonbeam for smart contract functionality while maintaining deep integration with Polkadot's cross-chain capabilities. We were among the first to successfully implement RMRK 2.0 standards with our Book of Lore NFT collection, establishing ourselves as pioneers in Polkadot's NFT and gaming space.

### What Evrloot is NOT
- We will never compromise on our core values or ethical gaming principles
- We will never implement pay-to-win mechanics
- We will do everything not to abandon our existing community during the transition period

### The strategic Pause of Evrloot
After four years of dedicated development and community building, without an OpenGov ask, Evrloot has reached a critical juncture. Despite our considerable success, the market conditions for Web3 games have drastically worsened in 2025, creating a challenging environment for funding and sustainability. Many Web3 gaming projects across the industry are struggling or shutting down due to widespread funding shortages. 
Unfortunately, we have been unable to secure the necessary funding to continue, which has led us to freeze Evrloot in its current state and reduce all operational costs, including salaries, to zero, without disbanding the company. 

### The Ask: Help with operational running cost
While this pause was a difficult but necessary step, we cannot sustain the game under these conditions in the long term and urgently need your help to preserve the community and maintain the infrastructure. We believe that, unlike many other teams, our exceptionally strong and loyal community positions Evrloot uniquely for success. This strategic pause is designed to preserve that community and strengthen our foundation, helping us secure the necessary funding to relaunch and continue growing the project within the Polkadot ecosystem.
