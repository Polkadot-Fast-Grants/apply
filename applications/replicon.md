# 📝 Replicon

## 🌟 Project Overview

Please provide the following:

#### If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tagline (one sentence summary)

Replicon: Own Your Digital Twin. Be Part of Every World.

#### A brief description of your project

Replicon is a decentralised platform that empowers individuals to create, own, and monetise AI-powered digital twins of themselves — complete with lifelike 3D avatars and cloned voices. These digital identities can be licensed as NPCs in video games, virtual worlds, metaverses, and other media, allowing users to become part of immersive digital experiences. Built on the Polkadot blockchain, Replicon ensures transparent licensing, secure ownership, and automated royalty distribution through smart contracts — unlocking a new era of personal empowerment in the digital economy.

#### An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Polkadot

Replicon integrates into the Polkadot ecosystem by leveraging its parachain architecture to ensure cross-platform interoperability, enabling users' digital twins to seamlessly move between different virtual worlds, games, and metaverses. By utilizing Polkadot’s blockchain infrastructure, we ensure decentralized ownership of digital identities through NFTs or Soulbound Tokens (SBTs), giving users full control over their likeness and licensing terms and seamless integration with other games or blockchains without being “vendor-locked”. The integration of smart contracts on Polkadot automates royalty distribution and ensures transparency in digital twin usage across various platforms and blockchains.

#### An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project

Our team’s inspiration for Replicon is deeply personal. Coming from the film and entertainment industry, particularly working as supporting artists and actors, we’ve experienced firsthand how the likeness, time, and talent of performers are often undervalued — especially in the age of digital reproduction and AI. The recent actors' strike highlighted a growing concern: the unchecked use of performers' digital likenesses without fair compensation or consent. AI-generated doubles, voice clones, and background characters are being created and reused at scale, with minimal transparency or financial benefit for the individuals involved. This exposed a critical need for ethical standards and creator ownership in digital media. Replicon is our answer to that need. We’re building a platform where people can take back control — turning their physical likeness and voice into protected, monetisable AI-powered assets. Through blockchain-based licensing, we're ensuring that individuals, not studios or algorithms, decide how their digital selves are used, and that they’re fairly compensated each time. Replicon isn’t just about innovation — it’s about empowerment, protection, and equity for digital creators and performers in the new era of AI and immersive media.

### 🔍 Project Details

We expect applicants to have a solid idea about the project's expected final state. Therefore, please submit (where relevant):

#### An overview of the technology stack to be used
- 3D scanning – RealityCapture or Polycam
- Voice cloning – ElevenLabs
- Smart Contracts – ink! / Substrate
- Web Frontend – React + Typescript
- Mobile App – Flutter
- Backend – Go + Blender Server
- Storage – IPFS
- Blockchain Integration – Polkadot Asset Hub + XCM

#### Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed

- **Replicon Capture Studio (Mobile App)** – The Replicon Capture Studio offers actors and supporting artists a simple and portable interface for capturing data that can be transformed into 3D avatars and AI NPCs.
- **Replicon API Backend** – Builds on the data from the Replicon Capture Studio and creates lifelike avatars and NPCs. This will house data in the staging phase, and not yet ready to commit to the blockchain/IPFS
- **Replicon Marketplace (Web App)** – Assets built by the Replicon API can be submitted and licensed on the web marketplace. At this point, assets and licensing smart contracts will be committed to the blockchain. The marketplace also provides a facet for film producers or gaming project managers to license the content, they can search by features and licensing requirements.

#### Any PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

As an early proof of concept, our team participated in the EasyA Hackathon, a premier Web3 developer event that brings together innovators building on emerging blockchain infrastructure.
Out of dozens of submissions, Replicon placed 3rd, earning recognition for innovation in the space of AI identity, decentralisation, and creator empowerment.
This validated the real-world relevance of our concept, and marked the beginning of our roadmap toward a full-scale platform.

#### Mockups/designs of any UI components

#### Data models / API specifications of the core functionality

- Asset Leasing Contract – The core contract that binds a virtual asset to a project for a specific period of time, which may or may not include other restrictions of use
- Platform Representation Contract – The contract that lets the Replicon platform represent the user who owns the asset during transactions. For advanced users, they can provide their alternative to the contracts

#### What your project is *not* or will *not* provide or implement

- We will **not** build a custom animation pipeline, we expect to reuse existing systems and simply act as an asset leasing platform
- We will **not** build a game engine, we intend to use existing platforms like Unity or Unreal to execute the behaviours
- We do **not** intend to replace all assets, we simply want to provide an easy alternative to ethically source human made assets

### 🧩 Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

#### Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

Our project gives the foundation for film, animation and gaming projects to ethically license content produced by actors. Given that gaming projects are getting a big push from the ecosystem, this service will become all the more important and accelerate the adoption of Polkadot for gaming or multimedia projects.

#### Who is your target audience?

- Production companies
- Actors and supporting artists who want to earn extra cash

#### What need(s) does your project meet?

- The need for actors and supporting artists to have control over their data
- A hassle-free marketplace for production companies to lease high-quality and lifelike CGI content alongside AI personalities for their film or gaming projects
- Agreements/leases are stored on the blockchain, which will help resolve disagreements and disputes over content licensing

#### Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem?

None within the ecosystem. There are other projects like storyprotocol.xyz which serves IP licensing for big production companies rather than individual identities for actors

##### If not, why might such a project not exist yet?

There has yet to be an economically viable yet sustainable alternative that serves the needs of both the production companies and actors

> **Note**: We prioritize projects building on Plaza/Polkadot Hub, games, and DeFi applications, though all types of projects will be considered.
