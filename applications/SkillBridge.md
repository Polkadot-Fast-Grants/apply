     A brief description of your project
#### *SkillBridge* is a decentralized freelance marketplace that leverages Polkadot’s blockchain infrastructure to address critical challenges in the global freelance economy. The platform targets three key issues: lack of trust between parties, payment delays and high fees, and access barriers faced by the underbanked.

#### By utilizing smart contracts for secure escrow, enabling instant cross-chain payments, and incorporating decentralized dispute resolution, SkillBridge creates a trustless environment that benefits freelancers and clients worldwide.

    An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Polkadot
#### 🔗 *SkillBridge* will be built as a parachain on Polkadot, leveraging cross-chain interoperability to enable seamless payments across multiple blockchains and currencies. The project will utilize the Substrate framework and ink! smart contracts to implement secure escrow services, milestone-based payments, and automated dispute resolution.

#### By taking advantage of Polkadot’s shared security model and cross-chain messaging (XCMP), SkillBridge can deliver secure, low-cost transactions while maintaining interoperability with a broad range of blockchain ecosystems.

    An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project
#### 💡 I am motivated to create this project because the $1.5 trillion global freelance economy—comprising 1.5 billion participants worldwide—continues to face fundamental challenges that blockchain technology is uniquely equipped to solve. Polkadot’s interoperable architecture offers an ideal foundation for building a truly global and accessible freelance marketplace, capable of connecting to multiple blockchain ecosystems and supporting fiat on/off ramps.

      Any PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
### Drawing on what we learn from EchoPay 2
[EchoPay 2](https://github.com/YanniWu88/EchoPay-2/tree/master "EchoPay 2")

EchoPay 2 is an innovative payment platform concept enabling users to conduct secure, cross-chain transactions through voice commands. This repository contains the initial proof-of-concept implementation focusing on the frontend interface, wallet connection, and voice input simulation.

Key takeaway would be connection wallet, and write smart contract on rust

* **MVP**: will focus on core escrow, payment, and dispute features, with a simple job board and wallet integration.
* **PoC**: Demonstrate escrow and payment flows using testnet tokens and a basic UI

        What your project is not or will not provide or implement

1. SkillBridge is not a traditional job board or recruitment platform for permanent employment
2. The platform will not offer general marketplace features beyond freelance services
3. We will not provide financial services beyond the payment mechanisms for completed work
4. The platform will not store or manage intellectual property rights beyond basic contract terms
5. SkillBridge will not act as a centralized arbiter, instead relying on decentralized governance mechanisms
6. SkillBridge will not provide fiat on/off-ramp services directly; instead, it will integrate existing bridges (e.g., Spacewalk, Stellar anchors).
7. It will not offer centralized arbitration; all dispute resolution is on-chain and community-driven.
8. No support for non-Polkadot blockchains except via approved cross-chain bridges.

    Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem?

- **Polka Finance** is a decentralized job marketplace built on the Polkadot ecosystem (and Aleph Zero), designed to connect freelancers and companies globally. It uses blockchain-based smart contracts for secure, transparent transactions, offers a dispute resolution system, and supports crypto payments. The platform aims to streamline hiring, ensure fair contracts, and make global talent accessible, with features like KYC for trust and OpenAI integration for smarter job matching.

[Polka Finance](https://taikai.network/en/nerdconf/hackathons/nerdathon/projects/cm04j49mo0ppowm016spayqd5/idea"Polka_Finance")

- **Imbue** is another Polkadot-powered freelancing platform. It allows project initiators to post tasks, receive bids from freelancers, and release payments through a milestone system. This ensures freelancers are paid for completed work and clients only pay when satisfied, leveraging blockchain for transparency and fairness.

- **BlockchainDevs** is a marketplace for hiring freelance Polkadot developers. While not a decentralized protocol, it connects companies with freelance blockchain developers, including those specializing in Polkadot. Freelancers can negotiate terms directly with clients and work remotely on a contract basis.

        If so, how is your project different?

- Focuses on instant, cross-chain payments and escrow for the global freelance market, not just Polkadot-native roles.
- Integrates on-chain, transparent dispute resolution and a blockchain-based reputation system.
- Prioritizes financial inclusion by leveraging stablecoins and fiat onramps via cross-chain bridges, expanding access to the unbanked.
- Build from client needs


1. Building a comprehensive freelance marketplace requires the integration of multiple complex systems, including payment processing, escrow, dispute resolution, and reputation management. However, blockchain development has historically focused more on pure financial applications than on addressing challenges in labor markets.
2. The technical expertise required to build both a user-friendly marketplace—particularly for users with little or no blockchain experience—and a robust blockchain infrastructure is rare. True cross-chain escrow and payments demand mature interoperability protocols and sophisticated smart contract infrastructure, which are only now becoming widely available on Polkadot.
3. In our recent hackathon win, EchoPay 2, we successfully used @polkadot/api to establish a quick and seamless connection to SubWallet, demonstrating our capability to work with Polkadot’s evolving ecosystem.
4. The timing is ideal: the convergence of remote work, DeFi, and broader Web3 adoption creates the perfect environment for SkillBridge to launch and scale.

### SkillBridge is positioned to fill this gap by creating a specialized solution for the global freelance economy on Polkadot.

  ## Team Expansion Plans

Team Expansion Plans:
Just found out about this grant on Saturday so I am in discussions with two experienced developers— [Dave Cheng Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davecheng82/) and ([James Walker Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-defi/)—either of whom may join the project, depending on their availability.

In addition, we are speaking with two more developers who have hands-on experience with Substrate development and are expected to join the team after the initial funding phase. Their expertise would significantly accelerate the development of more advanced features.

Relevant Experience:

Several members of our team, including myself, have personal experience working as freelancers and have encountered the exact challenges SkillBridge aims to solve. This gives us a unique, user-centered perspective that informs our product design and priorities.

We have also been active participants in the Polkadot ecosystem for over a year. Notably, we received a guarantee fund for our project EchoPay 2 at the EasyA London Hackathon 2024. In addition, we have attended numerous workshops, webinars, and community events to deepen our knowledge and strengthen our connections within the ecosystem.

    Other funding you may have applied for

On Thursday, 17 April 2025, I submitted my project [SKillBridge: Empowering Freelancers Through Decentralized Innovation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g6tVjUvINIDS3MUAqD0bIxgS1lInLzHLMLFrS-0P2ns/edit?tab=t.0) to the [Student Blockchain Event](https://moledao.io/#/event/8ac9b6be-343c-4f0a-bcb3-27068ab2e8f7). This submission is currently under review.
