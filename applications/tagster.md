# üìù Tagster: Gamified Data Labeling Platform 
- **Follow us on X** : https://x.com/0xtapster
## üåü Project Overview

### The Inspiration: Mata Shabri's Story
Long time ago, in the forests of ancient India, there lived a wise woman named Mata Shabri. Her dedication to serving Lord Rama was unmatched, and her efforts in gathering the best, most delectable fruits to present to Him became legendary. She would carefully choose the ripest, sweetest fruits, ensuring that only the finest offerings were given. This story of devotion and attention to detail has inspired Tagster ‚Äì a platform that brings modern-day "Shabris" to the world of AI development, ensuring the highest quality datasets for machine learning models.

**Tagster** transforms AI data labeling into a fun, rewarding experience. Our mobile app uses a TikTok-like swipe interface where users label images and videos while earning cryptocurrency rewards on Polkadot.

### The Problem We Solve
As AI and machine learning systems evolve, they need vast amounts of high-quality, reliable data to improve their models. However:
1. AI companies struggle to gather vast amounts of data that are both consistent and high-quality
2. Traditional methods of gathering labeled data are slow, labor-intensive, and prone to errors
3. The people doing labeling work are rarely fairly compensated

By building on Polkadot, we create a transparent, fair marketplace where labelers earn direct rewards while helping advance AI development, much like how Mata Shabri carefully selected the best fruits for Lord Rama.

## üîç Project Details

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next- JS mobile application with Polkadot.js integration
- **Backend**: Node-js for initial MVP data storage.
- **Blockchain**: Polkadot Plaza/Hub integration
  - Smart contracts for transparent reward distribution
  - NFT certificates that prove contribution quality
  - On-chain reputation system tracking labeler accuracy

### Core Components
- **Swipe Interface**: TikTok-inspired UI for quick, intuitive labeling with engaging animations
- **Verification System**: Multi-user consensus mechanism ensuring data quality
- **Reward Mechanism**: DOT-based payments with bonus multipliers for consistency and accuracy
- **Gamification Elements**: Leaderboards, achievements, and progression system with visual rewards

### User Experience Flow
1. User onboards with easy wallet creation/connection
2. Completes simple tutorial explaining the labeling process
3. Begins swiping through content (images)
4. Earns DOT rewards for verified contributions
5. Unlocks achievements and rises through leaderboards

### Not in Scope
- We will not build our own AI models
- We will not handle the training of AI with the labeled data
- Initial version will support image and video labeling only (not text or audio)
- No zero-knowledge proof implementation in this version

## üß© Ecosystem Fit

### Where Tagster Fits in Polkadot
Tagster creates a new DeFi use case by establishing a marketplace for AI data labor, directly connecting data providers with laborers through Polkadot's blockchain infrastructure.

### Target Audience
1. **Users**: Any users who access to internet & looking for legitimate ways to earn crypto and Scoll dating apps Or tiktok.
2. **AI Companies**: Organizations needing large volumes of labeled data
3. **Researchers & Academic institutions **: Academic institutions building AI models

### Needs Addressed
- Provides fair compensation for data labeling work
- Creates transparent verification of data quality
- Establishes ownership records through NFTs
- Gamifies a traditionally tedious process

### Similar Projects
While data labeling platforms exist (Scale AI, Amazon Mechanical Turk), none combine the gamified mobile experience with blockchain rewards and verification. On Polkadot specifically, there are no comparable projects addressing this market.

### Technical Components 

**AI Labeling Algorithm Approach:**

- Use majority voting with minimum 3 independent labels per item
- Apply confidence thresholds to identify ambiguous items
- Implement simple spam detection using time-based and pattern recognition approaches

**Polkadot Integration Details:**
- Utilize polkadot.js for wallet connectivity
- Implement the following specific APIs:
 - `api.tx.assets.transfer` for reward distribution
 - `api.query.system.account` for account verification
 - `api.tx.balances.transfer` for DOT payments
- Develop lightweight smart contracts using ink! for automated reward distribution

## Lexica.art Partnership Initiative

We're also excited to share that preliminary discussions are underway with Lexica.art to integrate their vast library of AI-generated images. This potential partnership would enable:

1. **A/B Testing of AI Images**: Users can choose between similar images generated with the same prompts but different parameters
2. **Null Hypothesis Testing**: Creating statistically significant datasets about user preferences
3. **Style Preference Analysis**: Helping identify which AI image generation styles users prefer

This unique collaboration would position Tagster as not just a data labeling platform, but a crucial research tool for advancing the state of AI image generation through real human feedback.


## üîÆ Future Plans

After completing the Fast-Grant, we plan to:

1. **Seek Additional Funding**: Apply for larger ecosystem grants and approach alliance Dao and YC.
2. **Expand Data Types**: Add support for text, audio, and specialized data formats
3. **Build AI Tools**: Create tools that help companies prepare their data for labeling
4. **Scale User Base**: Launch marketing campaigns to attract both labelers and companies
5. Build extensions for Secure data collections wtiht users.
6. **Content Feed Algorithm**: Personalized content delivery based on user preferences and labeling history
Our long-term vision is to make Tagster the standard platform for decentralized data labeling, creating a sustainable economy where individuals are fairly compensated for their contributions to AI development.
7. Implement inter-rater reliability algorithm (Cohen's Kappa)

### Vision is to go Beyond Traditional Social Media
Our ambition for Tagster extends beyond just a data labeling platform. We aim to create an alternative to Instagram and TikTok shorts where users can be rewarded for their engagement rather than just having their attention monetized by advertisers. By bringing this to Polkadot, we're creating a true Web3 social experience with real utility.

### Proven Track Record
- Our tagster project won the OpenCampus **AI Web3 Application with zkVerify** award
- Harshal is a Class of 2025 batch in Data Science & AI from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras with an experience for creating viral applications like AngryPets.io, Ordex.io, toradle.com demonstrates ability to build engaging products
- Our founder has consistently delivered award-winning projects in Web3 hackathons (45+ wins)
- Worked with Fast track startups - Ordex.io , Current - Ajna capital (UAE based VC fund), toradle.com 

Tagster aligns perfectly with Polkadot's vision of a connected, decentralized web by creating a fair marketplace that properly values human contributions to AI development. Unlike our previous zkVerify implementation, this version will focus on Polkadot's native capabilities to create a streamlined, user-friendly experience that can reach mainstream adoption.
