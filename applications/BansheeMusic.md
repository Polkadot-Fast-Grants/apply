üåü Project Overview:
Banshee Music- Music Airdrop Protocol
Banshee is a music NFT marketplace for fans to receive airdrops of song, albums, and rewards.

Banshee is a native project to Polkadot that will launch on the Polkadot Asset Hub. NFTs of songs will be airdropped to fans on the Asset Hub. We will be bringing songs, albums, and masters on to the Asset Hub. We are building on top of Audius, Subquery, and Polkadot to accomplish this goal.

The Banshee Team is committed to creating an ecosystem that allows musicians to remain independent and have financial stability. We believe Polkadot architecture gives us the best way to accomplish these goals.

üîç Project Details: 
Banshee is a music airdrop protocol that airdrops songs, albums, and other rewards to fans. We are a subscription-based NFT marketplace, but users are purchasing/signing up for airdrops of music sent to them on monthly basis. This project also brings the Audius ecosystem to Polkadot. Audius is the most popular web3 music platform with over 7.5million monthly active users. Banshee will be 1) integrate the Polkadot Asset Hub by deploying our contracts on its mainnet. 2) Intergrate Audius into the project as well bringing its users base to Polkadot's Asset Hub. 3) Build the Proof-of-Performance royality system on-top of Polkadot. A high-level overview: A marketplace listing samples of Audius artists music for fans to sign up for monthly airdrops of NFT songs, albums, or rewards from those artists. The Proof-of-Performance model is a royalty system to pay the artists by tracking the NFTs on-chain (transfers, resales, and attendance).

An overview of the technology stack to be used: 
1) Polkadot Asset Hub- NFTs of the songs will be deployed on the Asset Hub. Banshee will also utilize Polkadot's Precompiles by batching transactions for airdropping the NFTs to fans.
2) Audius- Banshee will integrate the Audius API to display samples of songs from musicians on the Banshee Marketplace.
3) Crossmint and Unlock Protocol will be integrated for a more user-friendly interface for fans to sign up for airdrops.
4) Subquery will be the indexer used to track Banshee NFT transactions for the minting and transfer of Banshee tokens to musicians for NFT resales.

Banshee is an NFT marketplace for fans to signup for monthly airdrops of music. Banshee is not a marketplace direct purchase of songs or albums. Banshee's purpose to create a stable stream of income for musicians. Checkout our article on Proof-of-Performance

Proof-of-Performance is a proof-of-work model where airdrops, tickets, and rewards are tracked by using Subquery and data oracles. The transaction data from the NFTs is used to mint the Banshee token to pay artists. The best comparison is to view musicians using the Banshee NFTs (airdropped NFT songs, albums, or tickets) as the "work" in this proof-of-work model. The musicians (Banshees) are therefore miners of the Banshee token on Polkadot. 

The Banshee token model will be an XCM token that utilizes Polkadots interoperablity for transfers and minting. Banshee's Marketplace can therefore support other chains, but the protocols utility token mints and settles on Polkadot.

üß© Ecosystem Fit: 
Banshee will bring music songs, albums, and masters to the Polkadot Asset Hub. Banshee is building on-top of Audius to extend their ecosystem to Polkadot. This will bring their 7.5 million user base to Polkadot. 

Banshee's target audience is the average Audius user/fan who would like to receive regular songs, rewards that are released to fans. Banshee also accomplishes the need for musicians to receive stable income from their work while remaining independent by 1) subscription based model for airdrops. 2) A verifiable, decentralized royalty model for tracking music transactions onchain (Via Subquery). The Polkadot Asset Hub will be the central chain that the project (Airdrops and Proof-of-Performance) are built on top of.  This project is unique in its model of focusing on subscription based airdrops of music while having a royality system that utilizes an indexer (Subquery).

üìä Development Status: 
NFT marketplace and airdrop smart contracts are currently on the Moonbase Alpha Testnet. A POC of the marketplace has been created as well. Hete is the projects github: https://github.com/Banshee-Music


üìÖ Development Roadmap
There will be 5 milestones/deliverables to be completed within 2 months:
1) Marketplace UI with Audius API integration. The UI should have listing of artists with song sample's from the Audius API. (1-2 weeks)
2) Crossmint integration to the UI for direct purchase of airdrop subscriptions. (1 week)
3) Integration of Pinata IPFS files for Music to be delivered to fans. The NFTs airdropped will give fans access to Pinata IPFS files storing songs. (1 week)
4) Proof-of-Performance smart contract integration to Subquery. Token smart contract that mints token with every new transaction from NFT marketplace smart contract. (2-3weeks)
5) Deployment of all smart contracts to Polkadot Asset Hub mainnet. (1-week)

Milestone	Deliverables	Cost (USD)	Estimated Completion
1	Features (Marketplace UI)- Audius Integration, Subscription UI	$2,000 2-3 weeks (20-30 hours of development)
2	Feature IPFS integration	$1,000	1-2 weeks. (10 hours of development)
3 Feature Proof-Of-Performance $5,000 2-3 weeks. (40 hours of development)
Total		$9,000	2 months
Make sure you show clearly what the funding is going towards (e.g. 30 hours of a full time employee at $X / hour).

5) Deployment of all smart contracts to Polkadot Asset Hub mainnet, documentation posted on homepage, and social media set up (X, Telegram). $1,000

üîÆ Future Plans
Please include:

How you intend to continue development after the Fast-Grant: 
Banshee Music will be a self-sustaining project that with minimal funding needed to launch and maintain the project. We have no plans additional funding other than the deployment of the Banshee token. We plan on integrating Spotify to the marketplace after the initial launch. 

Work you have already done: 
Right now there are no platforms focused on airdropping music to fans. This is a unique project and there is also no proof-of-work royalty system like Banshee's Proof-of-Performance.
Other funding you may have applied for- We not received any other funding past a hackathon win (Moonbeam Hackathon 2024).
