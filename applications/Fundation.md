# 📝 Fundation DApp Management System

## 🌟 Project Overview

- Simple and easy DApp deployment.
- Fundation is a modular DApp Management System (DMS) designed for the multichain future, similar to how WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla enabled developers to easily set up and manage their projects.
- This project is highly ambitious, but upon completion, it has the potential to drive significant growth in the Polkadot ecosystem, much like how WordPress and other CMS platforms transformed the web.
-The idea for this project emerged after I attempted to build my first DApp on Polkadot and realized the scarcity of tooling, not only for Polkadot but across Web3 in general. Existing tools are often Ethereum-based and locked into closed-source SaaS models.



### 🔍 Project Details
- For the front-end, I selected Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/ui for their rapid development capabilities. For blockchain interaction, I’m using Polkadot-API, paired with Turso DB for authentication and data storage that doesn’t require blockchain finality. 
- A rudimentary MVP concept is currently live at https://www.fundation.dev/, though it is still under active development. This grant will allow me to complete the core features, including expanded authentication options. At present, only wallet-based login is available, but I plan to add social login, email, and passkey support to enable broader access. I also aim to finalize the asset retrieval and send functions, optimizing them for simplicity and flexibility.
- The project will include detailed documentation on data models and API specifications for the core functionality,
- A simple visual flow of how a DApp connects to the Polkadot API.

- I am requesting funding to complete the base DMS, which includes authentication, asset viewing, and a send function with seamless, dynamic blockchain interaction. A DeFi module is excluded from this scope, as I estimate it will take longer than three months to develop.


### 🧩 Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
It supports DApp developers within the Polkadot ecosystem.
- Who is your target audience?
Junior developers and front-end developers seeking to build projects quickly.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
It simplifies the development process, enabling rapid idea deployment.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem? 
Yes, [Apillon](https://apillon.io/) on Polkadot, and [Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/) and [Magic](https://magic.link/) on Ethereum.
-  how is this project different? 
the goal is to create an open-source solution that anyone can host on their own server, prioritizing ease of use. Long-term, I envision an open-source SaaS-like platform that allows users to host their own decentralized services, akin to cPanel for web hosting.

### Team's experience

I am primarily a front-end developer, but over the past two years, I’ve explored backend technologies, focusing on authentication and its impact on user experience.


## 📊 Development Status
I’ve been working on this project intermittently, but I’m ready to commit more time. Currently, foundation.dev features a basic landing page and a rudimentary MVP concept.
 

## 📅 Development Roadmap

### Milestone One:
Complete the base functionality (nearly finished), including adding more authentication options, finalizing asset retrieval, and refining the UX and design.


### Milestone Two:
Optimize and refactor the code, then release it as open-source on GitHub with comprehensive documentation.



### Overview

- **Estimated Duration: 2 months, with the second month primarily focused on documentation and design.
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): 1 (just me)
- **Total Costs: $8,000 USD for two months of work

> Note that deliverables 0a to 0d are mandatory. Please adapt their specification to your project.

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Release all code and artifacts under the MIT License. |
| 0b. | Documentation | I will provide inline code documentation and a tutorial explaining how each base component works. |
| 0c. | Testing and Testing Guide | Core functions will have comprehensive unit tests, and UX testing will ensure the interface is simple and intuitive. |
| 0d. | Article | We will publish an **article** that explains what was done/achieved as part of the grant. |
| 1. | auth | Currently uses session-based auth with Polkadot wallet integration; passkeys, email, and social login are still to be added. |
| 2. | blockchain conntaion and dymic blockchain interaction | Dynamic blockchain interaction compatible with any relay chain or parachain with minimal effort. |

### 💰 Budget Breakdown

Please provide a breakdown of your budget by milestone:

| Milestone | Deliverables | Cost (USD) | Estimated Completion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Authentication and blockchain connection features | $5,000 | 1 months |
| 2 | Finalizing design and documentation| $3,000 | 1 months |
| **Total** |Fully functional DApp | **$8,000** | **2 months** |

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Post-Fast-Grant Development:
I plan to continue development, starting with a DeFi module (estimated at 4–6 months). Future modules include community features, staking, and possibly a game engine bridge, initially allowing the engine to communicate with the DApp via a local server (though this requires further research).


- Additional Funding:
I am open to pursuing additional grants for the modules and eventually plan to submit an OpenGov proposal.
- Vision for Growth and Impact:
This ambitious project aims to replicate WordPress’s success in the Polkadot ecosystem. With 43.5% of websites still running on WordPress, I envision Foundation having a similar transformative impact on DApp development.
