# üìù Autonomica

## üåü Project Overview

- **Tagline:** AI trading agents that learn your preferences, execute strategies, and preserve memory on-chain for full transparency and value retention.
- **Description:** Autonomica is a decentralized protocol that allows users to deploy personalized trading agents on the blockchain. These agents follow user-defined rules and preferences to execute DeFi strategies, with key decisions and outcomes stored on-chain for transparency and auditability. The MVP will focus on creating a functioning proof-of-concept that demonstrates the core concept with a simplified implementation.
- **Integration with Polkadot:** Autonomica will leverage Polkadot's ecosystem by building on a parachain (initially targeting Moonbeam due to its EVM compatibility) and using Polkadot.js for blockchain interactions. The system will be designed with future cross-chain expansion in mind, though the initial MVP will focus on single-chain execution for simplicity.
- **Motivation:** Our team aims to democratize algorithmic trading in DeFi by creating transparent, customizable trading agents that preserve their history and performance on-chain. We're passionate about expanding access to financial opportunities while preserving user sovereignty and strategy ownership.

### üîç Project Details

- **Technology Stack:**
  - **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
  - **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (on Moonbeam for EVM compatibility)
  - **Blockchain Interaction:** Polkadot.js API
  - **Backend Services:** Node.js
  - **Rule Engine:** JavaScript-based with configurable parameters
  - **Storage:** On-chain for critical decision data, conventional database for UI state

- **Core Components & Architecture:**
  1. **Agent Creation & Customization Layer:**
     - User preference selection through guided UI
     - Risk tolerance settings
     - Strategy template selection (2-3 basic templates initially)
     - Custom parameter configuration

  2. **On-Chain Memory System (Simplified):**
     - Transaction history and key decision points stored on-chain
     - Basic performance metrics tracking
     - Strategy parameter storage

  3. **Execution Layer:**
     - Rule-based trading logic
     - Transaction submission via Polkadot.js
     - Basic error handling
     - Performance monitoring

  4. **Strategy Ownership:**
     - Basic NFT representing strategy ownership
     - Simple transfer functionality

- **MVP Features:**
  - User onboarding flow with preference setting
  - 2-3 predefined strategy templates (e.g., DCA, basic rebalancing)
  - Dashboard for monitoring agent performance
  - On-chain transaction execution for basic trading functions
  - Strategy NFT minting capability
  - Complete documentation and examples

- **What Autonomica MVP is NOT:**
  - Not implementing complex AI/ML in the initial version (using rule-based logic instead)
  - Not focused on cross-chain execution initially (single parachain focus)
  - Not building a full marketplace for strategy trading (basic ownership only)
  - Not implementing advanced features like strategy composition or governance

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

- **Placement in the Polkadot Ecosystem:**
  - Autonomica enhances the DeFi capabilities on Polkadot by introducing automated trading strategies with on-chain transparency
  - It creates a foundation for future expansion across the Polkadot ecosystem as the protocol matures
  - Initially targeting Moonbeam for EVM compatibility to accelerate development

- **Target Audience:**
  - DeFi users seeking automated trading without sacrificing control or transparency
  - Novice traders looking to implement basic trading strategies without constant monitoring
  - Users interested in exploring algorithmic trading in a controlled environment

- **Unique Selling Points:**
  - Unlike centralized trading bots, Autonomica preserves user sovereignty with on-chain execution
  - The on-chain memory system creates transparency and auditability not available in most trading tools
  - Strategy NFTs create a foundation for future tokenization and trading of successful strategies
  - Built specifically for the Polkadot ecosystem with future cross-chain expansion in mind
