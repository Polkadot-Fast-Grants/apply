# üìù Lovable for Polkadot

## üåü Project Overview

Polkadot is the most resillient and flexible chain out there, so let's make it the default choice by making it easy for Web3 builders to Ship!

This project is to create a Lovable clone for web3 creators to type in an app they want to create and have AI automatically build it in the correct way for the Polkadot ecosystem.

This is a great way to go a step further than an LLM that's fine-tuned / RAGging docs, and help developers apply the tech to their idea. By making it easy, more projects will be started, and founders can spend less energy building and more energy commercialising.

We're passionate because we believe AI software builders are the future, and want to build this for the leading technology in the ecosystem. 


### üîç Project Details

Technical approach:
 - Fork Bolt.diy (an open source Lovable clone)
 - Edit the order of prompts and LLMs being called to work well for Polkadot
 - Add boilerplate projects for each of the common project types on Polkadot (super lightweight for LLM to work with)
 - Test how well it builds the common project types, and keep editing the prompts to do a great job.

To make this possible:
 - Learn how to build on the Polkadot chain
 - Learn what the common project types are
 - Build each of the common project types (e.g. games, defi, AI, tokens, marketplaces), then make a super lightweight version of each
 - Add documentation for the LLM to know how to customise them for the users' specific app idea.


### üß© Ecosystem Fit

Once stable, this project can appear in Polkadot docs and enable all Polkadot developers to get started quickly with Polkadot.

### Team's experience

 - Worked with DeepMind
 - Worked with Faculty AI (Europe's largest Applied AI consultancy and OpenAI's first implementation partner)
 - Worked with Unkillable, where I helped build 8 different growth teams for ~Series A stage startups
 - Founded a company, raised 6 figures, built a product, sold my stake as part of a technology acquisition strategy towards Visa.

## üìä Development Status

We have a Lovable clone that can build a Polkadot app, but it doesn't consistently work. We need to find the failure modes and adapt the LLMs to consistently work.
Then we need to do the work in the Project Details section.

## üìÖ Development Roadmap

Milestone 1: Stable build of a Polkadot Dapp
 - AI can produce a stable build on the first shot
 - Grant application team can recieve a link, enter a prompt, and see a rendered app on the first shot (works for one type of app). They can keep prompting to edit, fix, and extend.

Milestone 2: Multiple projects supported
 - Multiple common Polkadot project types supported (not just one)
 - Grant application team can prompt-generate multiple project types.

Milestone 3: Extensibility for Polkadot ecosystem documented
 - Publish article, share it with the Polkadot ecosystem, find out what they want and where the project should go from here.
 - Documented process for training the LLM to build further projects, so Polkadot team or ourselves can add project types easily
 - Unit testing, refactoring, prepare for extensibility
 - Grant application team can see Docs, Tests, Article, and Notes on what external people want to see.

### Overview

- **Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (maximum 3 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (maximum $10,000 USD)

> Note that deliverables 0a to 0d are mandatory. Please adapt their specification to your project.

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License: MIT |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can contribute to the open source project |
| 0c. | Testing and Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by comprehensive unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Article | We will publish an **article** that explains what was done/achieved as part of the grant. |
| 1. | Stable builds | Users can prompt the AI to build a Polkadot Dapp |
| 2. | Mulitple projects | Multiple project types will be supported |
| 3. | Extensibility | Docuentation and refactoring to make it easy for the project to be taken beyond the current vision |

### üí∞ Budget Breakdown

Please provide a breakdown of your budget by milestone:

| Milestone | Deliverables | Cost (USD) | Estimated Completion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Stable builds | $5,000 | 1.5 months |
| 2 | Multiple projects | $4,000 | 1 months |
| 3 | Extensible | $1,000 | 0.5 months |
| **Total** | | **$10,000** | **3 months** |

## üîÆ Future Plans

We hope this project becomes the default way for people who are unfamiliar with Polkadot code to start a Polkadot project.

We intend to keep the LLM instructions and boilerplates up-to-date (or synced with the right documentation), so that it continues to build useful Dapps.

We will also seek grant and VC funding to expand the business to more project types, reducing the technical barrier to building Web3 projects!


## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Information

We've been interested in Freight and Lovable for X before this weekend, but this idea really came together during the hackathon weekend.
 - No other funding, no other team contributions
