# üìù PolkaFarm

## üåü Project Overview

PolkaFarm is a secure, user-friendly yield farming DApp built on Polkadot Asset Hub, enabling users to stake WND tokens and earn PLKF rewards through simple, efficient Solidity smart contracts.

PolkaFarm integrates directly with Polkadot's Asset Hub parachain, leveraging its EVM compatibility, native token staking capabilities, and shared security model to deliver a seamless DeFi experience. The platform demonstrates how traditional yield farming can be enhanced through Polkadot's unique cross-chain architecture and low fee structure.

Our team is passionate about expanding DeFi accessibility beyond high-gas networks like Ethereum. We believe Polkadot's parachain ecosystem offers the perfect architecture for creating interoperable financial applications that are both affordable to use and secure by design. PolkaFarm serves as an important DeFi primitive that demonstrates these capabilities while providing real value to users.

### üîç Project Details

### Technology Stack
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity 0.8.18+, Hardhat development environment, OpenZeppelin security patterns
- **Frontend**: React.js with functional components, ethers.js v6 for blockchain interaction, responsive CSS with dark/light mode
- **Blockchain**: Polkadot Asset Hub (currently deployed on Westend testnet)
- **Testing**: Hardhat testing framework with Chai assertions

### Core Components

1. **PolkaFarmToken Contract** (PLKF)
   - Minimal ERC-20 implementation for reward distribution
   - Minting capability restricted to the staking contract
   - Standard transfer and approval functions
   - Ownership pattern for administrative control

2. **PolkaFarmStaking Contract**
   - Direct staking of native WND tokens (Westend's native currency)
   - MasterChef-inspired reward distribution algorithm
   - Block-based reward calculation using accumulator pattern
   - Early withdrawal penalty to incentivize longer staking periods
   - Secure fund management with ownership controls

3. **React Frontend Application**
   - Clean, intuitive interface for staking operations
   - Real-time statistics display of APY, total staked, rewards
   - Wallet integration with MetaMask
   - Responsive design with dark/light mode toggle
   - Local storage for user preferences

### Architecture

The system follows a simple but effective architecture:
1. Users stake WND (native token) in the staking contract
2. The contract tracks stake amounts and block numbers
3. Rewards accrue proportionally to stake amounts
4. The staking contract mints PLKF tokens as rewards when users withdraw

The reward calculation uses the "reward debt" pattern, where:
1. Each time rewards are calculated, the global accumulator increases
2. User rewards are calculated as the difference between accrued rewards and reward debt
3. This method ensures correct reward distribution even with varying stake amounts over time

### Existing Work

PolkaFarm is already deployed on the Polkadot Asset Hub Westend testnet:

**PolkaFarmToken Contract:**
- Address: `0xeb3f68def0a92755f12afbc78c7c091882008481`
- [View on Asset Hub Westend Explorer](https://assethub-westend.subscan.io/account/0xeb3f68def0a92755f12afbc78c7c091882008481)

**PolkaFarmStaking Contract:**
- Address: `0x54c27ad8a9a35902b304c1ddda79711f23d1dd48`
- [View on Asset Hub Westend Explorer](https://assethub-westend.subscan.io/account/0x54c27ad8a9a35902b304c1ddda79711f23d1dd48)

### UI Mockups
The application is already implemented with a complete UI featuring:
- Landing page with key platform statistics
- Dashboard for user staking operations
- Dark and light mode support
- Responsive design for all device sizes

Screenshots are available in the README.md file of our repository.

### Project Limitations
PolkaFarm will NOT:
- Implement governance functions in the initial version (planned for future milestone)
- Support tokens beyond WND and PLKF in the initial implementation
- Include advanced features like autocompounding or lending in the MVP
- Launch on Polkadot mainnet until security audits are completed (post-grant)


### üß© Ecosystem Fit

### Position in Polkadot Ecosystem
PolkaFarm serves as a fundamental DeFi primitive on Polkadot Asset Hub, providing a simple but essential yield farming mechanism that can become a building block for more complex DeFi applications in the ecosystem. It demonstrates how traditional DeFi concepts can be enhanced through Polkadot's unique architecture.

### Target Audience
1. DeFi users looking for lower-cost alternatives to Ethereum-based yield farming
2. Polkadot token holders seeking additional yield opportunities
3. DeFi beginners who appreciate the simple, clean interface and lower barrier to entry
4. Developers looking for examples of DeFi implementations on Polkadot Asset Hub

### Needs Addressed
1. Accessible yield opportunities for Polkadot ecosystem tokens
2. Lower-cost DeFi alternative to Ethereum-based platforms
3. User-friendly entry point to DeFi for Polkadot users
4. Technical demonstration of EVM capabilities on Polkadot Asset Hub

### Similar Projects and Differentiation
While yield farming exists on many chains, there are currently few mature yield farming applications specifically built for Polkadot Asset Hub. Existing options like:
- Acala's aUSD staking
- Parallel Finance's staking pools

Differentiation points:
1. Direct native token staking (WND) without requiring wrapped tokens
2. Simplified UX designed for broader adoption
3. EVM compatibility allowing familiar tooling for Ethereum developers
4. Focus on Polkadot Asset Hub specifically rather than a separate parachain
