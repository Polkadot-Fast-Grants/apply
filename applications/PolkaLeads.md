## 🧩 Ecosystem Fit

The Web2 sales and growth world is starving for new, untapped, high-value leads, while traditional channels like LinkedIn, cold email, and paid ads are oversaturated and increasingly expensive. Our tool bridges this gap by helping businesses reach qualified decision-makers hidden in the **"underdog"** blockchains - a market segment with minimal competition and strong intent.

## 🌐 Current Opportunity
- 540K monthly active wallets on Polkadot
- 32M monthly active wallets across other “underdog” blockchains (PolkaDot, Cosmos, Avalanche, Near, Aptos, Sui)
- 95%+ of B2B sales tools ignore these ecosystems

This is a massive blue-ocean lead pool that is largely invisible to Web2 lead-gen tools and even most Web3 CRM competitors.

## 🔗 Web2 Use Cases

- Early Liquidity / TVL Growth: Use wallet-linked leads with existing token balances to onboard liquidity providers and boost TVL for DeFi apps.


## 🧠 Why Polkadot First

Polkadot is the perfect entry point for wallet-based lead generation because:

🛡️ 90% fewer ads than Ethereum or BNB → less noise, higher response rates.

⚙️ 70% of wallets are builders (not airdrop hunters or NFT flippers).

👨‍💻 60% are developers, validators, or power users → exactly the type of high-intent, B2B-friendly leads Web2 sales teams crave.

🧬 Strong “underdog” identity → easy to rally community attention and build loyalty by being the first tool to take them seriously.



###  Competitive Landscape: 

| NAME          | Pay-Per-Lead | Underdog B-chains | Cost          |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------- |
| ADDRESSABLE   | X            | X                 | \$1500+/month |
| COOKIE 3      | X            | X                 | \$600+/month  |
| ABSOLUTE LABS | X            | X                 | Enterprise    |



### ⚡ Our Advantage: 

✅ Flexible pay-per-lead pricing → no expensive monthly lock-ins.

✅ Focus on underdog blockchains first → zero competition, high-value leads. 

✅ Faster onboarding → no enterprise friction, plug-and-play for growth teams.

## 🧩 GMS 

We are planning to apply for the marketing bounty after delivering the milestones in this grant campaign. There we will detailed dive into the specifics of marketing and sales of the product, but here we can already outline concepts:

- starting out with guerilla type campaigns aimed at the small-middle size sales/marketing agencies both Web2 and Web3. Our angle is: “Untapped Web3 Leads from “underdog” blockchains” 

a) Activating comment bots on tiktok and reddit to drive traffic to our website. As their social media pages usually don’t have a lot of views and comments - they will definitely see them. 

b) Also we are looking into creating viral momentum on X using yapping campaings center we around our tech wrapped in a fun way. 

### Example: 

1. “Roast My Wallet Tool”. It’s a tool based on our LeadScore algorithm designed to roast your wallet in a fun way like: “50 tokens. Balance: $3.47. That’s not a wallet, that’s a parking meter.” or “Wallet says ‘Web3 pioneer,’ bank account says ‘Web2 employee’.” 


2. Public Leaderboard 
A playful “Wall of Fame / Wall of Shame”:
 • Top Degens of the Week (most microcaps bought).
 • Gas Guzzlers (most wasted ETH on fees).
 • Dust Kings (most tokens under $1).
 • Whale of the Day (largest single wallet swap). 


3. Wallet Matchmaking 
 • “Find your DeFi soulmate wallet.”
 • Your tool matches two wallets by transaction patterns, risk appetite, or token overlap. 


c) Making live streams where people can drop their wallets and we rate and roast them live on screen. 


d) Direct reach out to agencies offering free trial.
