## üîç Project Details

Technology Stack:

- Blockchain: Polkadot, Polkadot-API (PAPI)

- Identity verification with: KILT, External APIs, ENS/PNS records, DAO rosters, POAP claims, etc. 

- XMTP for wallet-to-wallet messaging.

- Data Layer:
- DotLake: Leverages DotLake‚Äôs BigQuery tables to provide real-time wallet data filtration for lead generation and on-chain analytics. This enables highly targeted lead identification and scoring based on transaction volumes and wallet behaviors.

- PostgreSQL, Redis.

- Frontend:
Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

- Backend:
Node.js/Express: A fast and lightweight backend framework for creating API services. Express powers the communication between the frontend, backend, and Polkadot blockchain, handling user requests and data processing.

- Talisman Wallet

- Development Tools:
GitHub, Docker


## üß© Ecosystem Fit

The Web2 sales and growth world is starving for new, untapped, high-value leads, while traditional channels like LinkedIn, cold email, and paid ads are oversaturated and increasingly expensive. Our tool bridges this gap by helping businesses reach qualified decision-makers hidden in the "underdog" blockchains - a market segment with minimal competition and strong intent.

## üåê Current Opportunity
- 540K monthly active wallets on Polkadot
- 32M monthly active wallets across other ‚Äúunderdog‚Äù blockchains (PolkaDot, Cosmos, Avalanche, Near, Aptos, Sui)
- 95%+ of B2B sales tools ignore these ecosystems

This is a massive blue-ocean lead pool that is largely invisible to Web2 lead-gen tools and even most Web3 CRM competitors.

## üîó Web2 Use Cases
### üè¶ Finance & Tax
- Crypto Wealth Insurance / Digital Asset Protection
Agencies can pitch insurance products that protect portfolios and wallets against theft, hacks, or loss.


- Crypto/Fiat Tax Services

### üåç Travel & Digital Nomad Lifestyle
- Book Flights & Hotels with DOT
Partner Web2 businesses that accept Coinbase Commerce to allow crypto payments.


- Co-Living Spaces in Global Hotspots
Target DOT holders for nomad-friendly communities in Lisbon, Bali, Buenos Aires, and other hubs.


- Relocation & Residency Services
Run wallet-linked ad campaigns for Estonia e-residency, Portugal golden visa, or Dubai relocation packages.


- Crypto-Inclusive Travel Insurance
Sell policies that cover laptops, wallets, and digital assets for travelers moving across borders.



### üîê Hardware & Security
- Privacy-Centric Devices
Market Web2 brands like Purism (Linux phones) or Ghost laptops directly to DOT users.


- Physical Security
Promote safes, biometric locks, and dedicated insurance for hardware wallets and sensitive devices.



## üîó Web3 Use Cases
### Community & Premium Services

### Web3 Infrastructure & Data Services

### Staking & Yield Services

### Parachain-Specific Growth
- Crowdloan Contributor Acquisition: Target DOT holders who actively stake or govern with personalized campaigns to drive contributions to parachain crowdloans.


- Early Liquidity / TVL Growth: Use wallet-linked leads with existing token balances to onboard liquidity providers and boost TVL for DeFi apps.


## üß† Why Polkadot First

Polkadot is the perfect entry point for wallet-based lead generation because:
üõ°Ô∏è 90% fewer ads than Ethereum or BNB ‚Üí less noise, higher response rates.
‚öôÔ∏è 70% of wallets are builders (not airdrop hunters or NFT flippers).
üë®‚Äçüíª 60% are developers, validators, or power users ‚Üí exactly the type of high-intent, B2B-friendly leads Web2 sales teams crave.
üß¨ Strong ‚Äúunderdog‚Äù identity ‚Üí easy to rally community attention and build loyalty by being the first tool to take them seriously.



### ü•ä Competitive Landscape:
NAME			Pay-Per-Lead	Underdog B-chains	Cost
ADDRESSABLE 	X			X			$1500+/month
COOKIE 3		X			X			$600+/month
ABSOLUTE LABS	X			X			Enterprise


### ‚ö° Our Advantage:
‚úÖ Flexible pay-per-lead pricing ‚Üí no expensive monthly lock-ins.
‚úÖ Focus on underdog blockchains first ‚Üí zero competition, high-value leads.
‚úÖ Faster onboarding ‚Üí no enterprise friction, plug-and-play for growth teams.
