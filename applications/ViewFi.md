### 🧩 Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
ViewDrop fits into Polkadot's ecosystem as a DeFi application that bridges traditional marketing with web3 rewards, driving mainstream user adoption through familiar video content experiences enhanced with blockchain-based incentives.

- Who is your target audience?
Primary: Brands and marketers seeking innovative, ROI-driven advertising solutions
Secondary: Web3 protocols wanting to grow their user base through rewarded video campaigns
Tertiary: End users who want to be rewarded for their attention and engagement

- What need(s) does your project meet?
 ViewFi addresses the critical need for privacy-compliant, engaging marketing solutions in the post-cookie era while simultaneously onboarding mainstream users to web3 through value exchange mechanisms.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, why might such a project not exist yet?
No direct competitors currently offer the same solution on any blockchain. Our unique approach combines video marketing, web3 rewards, and enterprise-grade partnerships, positioning us as the first-mover in this emerging category.

> **Note**: We prioritize projects building on Plaza/Polkadot Hub, games, and DeFi applications, though all types of projects will be considered.
