LearnFi

üåü Project Overview
Tagline: Learn. Earn. Grow ‚Äî A Web3-powered learning platform for Africa.

Description:
LearnFi is a Web3-based learning platform designed to incentivize education through peer learning, live sessions, NFT certifications, and crypto rewards. The platform enables users in Africa‚Äîstarting with Nigeria‚Äîto gain knowledge, teach others, earn on-chain certificates, and receive token rewards through community-led learning.

Relation to Polkadot:
We plan to build LearnFi‚Äôs blockchain components using the Polkadot ecosystem, leveraging its scalability, cross-chain interoperability, and Substrate-based infrastructure. Our MVP will incorporate wallet login, smart contract-enabled sessions, NFT minting for milestone certifications, and token integrations for partner protocols.

Why We‚Äôre Building This:
We believe Web3 can democratize education in underserved regions. Our founder, though not a developer, has a background in RPA and is working with a technical team (frontend, backend, full-stack, and blockchain engineers) ready to build LearnFi's MVP once initial funding is secured. These developers were formerly part of another startup that shut down and are prepared to build this under a new vision.

Current Phase:
We are currently in the ideation and planning phase. This grant will support the development of our MVP.

üîç Project Details
Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Smart Contracts: Solidity (for EVM compatibility), ink! (if native Substrate integration)
- Blockchain: Polkadot/Substrate
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication: WalletConnect, Polkadot.js
- NFT minting: RMRK or custom NFT pallet (Substrate)
- Hosting: IPFS/Pinata (for metadata), Vercel/Netlify (web)

Documentation & Architecture:
We will document APIs, contract structure, and smart contract flows using Markdown and OpenAPI. A basic MVP architecture diagram is in progress.

Limitations:
- MVP will be a desktop/mobile-web version only.
- Tokenomics and full DAO governance models are not included in this phase.
- MVP will not support multi-language localization yet.

üß© Ecosystem Fit
**Fit in Polkadot:**
We aim to launch LearnFi on Polkadot due to its developer-friendly ecosystem, NFT support, and potential to grow within the Plaza/Polkadot Hub. We intend to leverage cross-chain learning credentials and token partnerships.

Target Audience:
African youth, students, educators, career switchers, and freelancers.

Needs Solved:
- Access to quality, community-driven education
- Recognition through decentralized certificates
- Earning opportunities from teaching and learning

Similar Projects in Polkadot:
None focused on learning in Africa with NFT/milestone gamification. LearnFi stands out by blending DeFi, learning, and social engagement.
