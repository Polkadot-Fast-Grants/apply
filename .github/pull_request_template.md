### ðŸ’ª Project Abstract
CampusThread is a decentralized social media platform designed for the global student community of over 250 million individuals. It empowers students to share real-time updates, ask questions, and connect with peers worldwideâ€”while earning from their content. At its core, CampusThread integrates the KILT Protocol to issue verified student identities as decentralized credentials, enhancing content trust, reward systems, and ad targeting in a privacy-preserving way.

This grant focuses on building the open-source identity verification infrastructure using KILT and integrating it into the CampusThread ecosystem. By enabling verified, on-chain student credentials, the platform will unlock new use cases for student creators, advertisers, and developers. This effort will bring a large new user baseâ€”students, creators, and businessesâ€”into the Polkadot ecosystem and lay the foundation for future decentralized education and creator economy applications.
