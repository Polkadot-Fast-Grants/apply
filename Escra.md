# Stablecoin + Micro-Escrow for Volatile Economies (Built on Polkadot)

## TL;DR

We are building a **USD-backed stablecoin** and a **decentralized micro-escrow system on Polkadot**, backed by fiat reserves, to solve two critical problems faced by traders in the Global South:

- Stable, low-cost cross-border payments for businesses and freelancers.
- Secure, affordable escrow for informal traders without access to financial infrastructure.

Our system combines stability, security, and low fees to deliver real financial tools where they’re needed most.

## Problem 1: Currency Volatility Threatens International Trade

Small businesses and freelancers in emerging markets face:

- Rapid currency devaluation  
  _e.g., Naira lost 50% since 2023, Peso lost 40% in 2024 — Bloomberg_
- Unpredictable FX rates  
  Losses in global trade due to unstable local currency.
- High payment fees  
  Bank transfers and remittance fees are 5–10% — _World Bank 2024_

## Our Solution: USD-Pegged Stablecoin on Polkadot

We are launching a **USD-backed stablecoin on Polkadot**, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, backed by fiat reserves held by a regulated custodian.

### How It Works

- **Fiat On/Off-Ramps**  
  Local currency → stablecoin via agents, banks, or exchanges.
- **Wallet Integration**  
  Users send/receive/store stablecoin globally.
- **Instant Cross-Border Payments**  
  Low-cost and fast transactions using Polkadot infrastructure.

### Benefits for International Traders

- Preserve earnings against inflation
- Save on fees (under $0.01 per transaction)
- Get paid instantly, globally

## Problem 2: Informal Traders Lack Secure Payment Systems

Informal trade accounts for over 50% of GDP in many developing economies. Yet:

- No fraud protection
- No escrow or dispute tools
- Constant currency depreciation

---

## Our Solution: Decentralized Micro-Escrow on Polkadot

We're building a **smart contract-based escrow system** using our stablecoin on Polkadot to protect local, small-scale trades.

### How It Works

- Funds are locked in escrow until both buyer and seller confirm delivery.
- Disputes are handled via on-chain peer review.
- Stablecoin ensures value retention in USD terms.

### Benefits for Informal Traders

- Reduces fraud with conditional payments
- Holds value despite local currency swings
- No bank needed — just a phone

## Why Polkadot?

- Interoperability with other chains and systems
- Low fees — perfect for microtransactions
- Scalability through parachains and shared security
- Custom logic using Substrate for local market-specific rules
