## üåü Project Overview

**Tagline:**  
Offers a Web3 street team platform to help fans support artists and brands by completing missions, earning rewards, and tracking impact on-chain.

**Description:**  
MinnieMissions is a Web3 platform where fans complete real-world and digital promotional missions ‚Äî like poster drops, social shares, and referrals ‚Äî in exchange for Vibe Points (VP), NFTs, and DOT-based rewards. Fans can generate custom QR codes tied to their wallets and track mission completion, proof of attendance, and event referrals. Artists (like DR ADAKU) and brands (like EasyA) can create custom MinnieSquads and MinnieReps, and reward grassroots promotion.  

We are building MinnieMissions with the polkadot smart contracts** for mission submission, VP tracking, and streaks. Rewards and NFTs are issued via **Polkadot Asset Hub**, and we use **XCM** to connect the two.  

We‚Äôre applying to run a **pilot immediately**, where fans will earn VP by completing poster and referral missions to onboard users to EasyA's events etc. The goal is to prove the reward system in a live use case with real-world engagement. In the first instance, some manual aspects such as identifying and onboarding pilot users to get feedback will strengthen the value of the project long term.

**Why we're building this:**  
Fans do a lot of promo for creators and companies that they love ‚Äî we believe those efforts should be rewarded on-chain as superfans are fundamental to the growth of artists and brands. We‚Äôre passionate about fan economies, 'fandom' culture, and Web3 accountability. Ultimately, we're showing gratitude for people who care, and they deserve it! Imagine if MinnieMissions helps creatives and brands build their first 1000 superfans and then we have a global ecosystem of superfans / different 'MinnieSquads'.

## üîç Project Details

### Technology Stack  
- **Smart Contracts:** Ink! deployed on contract parachain (Moonbeam)
- **Token Issuance:** Polkadot Asset Hub (VP, NFTs, badges)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** React + Polkadot.js wallet connector
- **Storage:** IPFS (optional) for poster proofs

### Core Features  
- Mission submission + VP tracker  
- Streak & timestamp logic  
- Payment splitting (artist, treasury, fan)  
- QR-based mission & referral tracking  
- NFT + VP reward minting via Asset Hub  
- XCM-based cross-chain reward flow  

### What we are NOT doing (yet)  
- We're not building our own parachain in this phase (MinnieChain is future roadmap)  
- No on-chain DAO voting logic (planned in later stage)

## üß© Ecosystem Fit

**Where we fit:**  
We sit at the intersection of community, marketing, vibes and culture. We're onboarding real-world users to Web3 via fan culture and missions ‚Äî driving interaction with brands and artists across the Polkadot ecosystem.

**Target Audience:**  
- Music fans and superfans  
- Brands looking for authentic promotion  
- Community based platforms (e.g., EasyA)  
- Artists and creators building on Polkadot  

**What need we solve:**  
There is no scalable way to reward grassroots fan marketing on-chain. We solve that with QR code mission proof, VP, and on-chain reward logic.

**Similar projects?**  
There are loyalty programs in Web3, but none focused on culture, IRL poster tasks, QR referrals, and artist-led squads. We‚Äôre bringing the Web2 street team model on-chain ‚Äî transparently and rewardably.
